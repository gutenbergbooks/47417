<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Dear Boys</span>:—</p>

<p>I wonder if any of you are superstitious, or
if you believe in “signs”? I, myself, do not,
but as this happens to be the thirteenth book in
the Motor Boys series, I just thought I’d mention
it, more as a joke than anything else.</p>

<p>You know some persons think thirteen is unlucky.
I do not, and I am sure you do not,
either. So I venture to hope that I have been
lucky enough to write for you, in this thirteenth
volume, a book you will like better than any of
the preceding ones that I have been happy to
pen.</p>

<p>Certainly, Jerry, Ned and Bob, when they
went after the radium treasure, on Snake Island,
in the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, had
a chance to believe in “signs” if they were so
inclined. But when they saw the strange
“ghosts” they were not a bit frightened, and,
later on, they discovered the cause of them.</p>

<p>This story, though a complete tale in itself, is
linked with the others in the series. It tells how
the Motor Boys, hearing through Professor
Snodgrass, of a place where radium was supposed
to be located, set off to find it. They had many
adventures, and were in not a little danger.
Then, too, they had to proceed against Noddy
Nixon, who had unlawfully taken their motorship.</p>

<p>I venture to hope that you will like this story,
and that you will care for more about the boys,
whom I have come to regard as very good friends
of mine. I should dislike, very much indeed,
saying good-bye to them.</p>

<p>So, wishing you all the pleasure possible in
the reading of this story, I remain,</p>

<p class="noic">Yours cordially,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Clarence Young</span>.</p>

<p>“But, Professor, do you really think it’s
true?” asked Ned Slade, looking at the elderly
gentleman, whose bald head glistened in the sunlight,
as he sat leafing the pages of a scientific
book.</p>

<p>“Is what true, Ned?” inquired Jerry Hopkins,
who had crossed the room to look out of
a window.</p>

<p>“What Professor Snodgrass was telling just
now, about a fortune in radium being on a lonely
little island in the Colorado River, somewhere
in the Grand Canyon.”</p>

<p>“Radium!” gasped Bob Baker, turning slowly
in a big chair.</p>

<p>“Yes, radium,” answered Ned, at whose house
the other motor boy chums had called to meet
their old friend, the professor, who was paying
a short visit to Mr. Slade. “Radium, Bob.
Do you get the idea, or are you still trying to
figure out how long it will be until lunch time?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>“Aw, quit it,” begged the fat lad. “I guess
I can think of something besides grub, once in
a while. But I wasn’t listening very closely.
What is it about radium? That’s the stuff they
use to set diamonds in, instead of gold; isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Say, what’s the matter with you, Bob?”
cried Jerry, a tall, and well-built lad, as he
wheeled around from the window. “Set diamonds
in radium? You’re thinking of platinum,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s right!” admitted Bob.</p>

<p>“Radium!” broke in Ned. “I guess they’d
be more likely to set radium in a diamond, if
they could; eh, Professor?”</p>

<p>“Well,” admitted the little scientist with a
smile, “it’s valuable enough to be set in diamonds,
but I’m afraid it would be too dangerous
to carry around that way. It can’t be exposed
carelessly, you know.”</p>

<p>“Dangerous?” asked Bob. “How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Radium, that wonderful metal, as it is sometimes
called, and about which so much has been
written, yet about which even the greatest scientists
admit that they know very little, can cause
very severe burns if brought near a person, and
not protected in some way.</p>

<p>“The rays, or emanations from it, pass
through almost all substances, you know, and
not only does it cause burns, but also forms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
mental diseases. It is a dangerous, as well as
very valuable, metal.”</p>

<p>“But what’s this Ned said about some being
on an island in the Grand Canyon of the Colorado?”
persisted Bob. “That sounds interesting.
Maybe there’s a chance for us to take a
trip, and get some. Let’s hear more about it,
Professor, please.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that I can say much,”
came from the scientist. “I just happened to see
a mention of radium in this book I was looking
at, and I just told Ned that there was said to
be a valuable deposit of it on this island—Snake
Island, I believe it is called—though I don’t
know why. Probably from some Indian name.”</p>

<p>“And I asked him if he believed it was true,”
added Ned.</p>

<p>“As to that I can’t say,” resumed Uriah Snodgrass.
“All I know is that some years ago a
scientific expedition from Hartwell College set
out to learn if the rumor about the radium was
true. They had the story, I understand, from
some prospectors who were searching for gold.
The prospectors landed on this island, because
their boat was wrecked, and one of them picked
up a piece of stone, whether it was hornblende
or pitchblende I can’t recall, but you know
radium is often found in those substances.</p>

<p>“At any rate, one of the prospectors kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
this piece of mineral, and when he and his friends
left the island he took it with him, not knowing
what it was. Later he gave it to a scientist, as
a curiosity, and the latter at once recognized
what it was, and learned where it came from.</p>

<p>“It was sent to Hartwell College, with which
the scientist was connected, and aroused a great
deal of interest. An expedition was at once
fitted up, and about a year ago started for Snake
Island.”</p>

<p>“Did they get there?” asked Bob eagerly.
“And did they get any gold?”</p>

<p>“They did not, I regret to say,” replied the
professor rather solemnly. “As for gold, they
would scarcely have picked it up, had there been
any, if there was radium to be had, for there
is no comparison in the values of the two. With
radium at ten thousand dollars, or so, an ounce,
you can easily figure what a little bit would be
worth.</p>

<p>“At any rate, the expedition never even got
to Snake Island. They started down the Colorado
in a boat, but it was wrecked, and the party
barely escaped alive. This so discouraged them
that they returned, and as far as I know, no
one since has set foot on the place where the
radium is supposed to be. Yes, it was a sad
piece of business.”</p>

<p>“Why sad?” asked Jerry Hopkins. “Because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
science missed the chance to get the
radium?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, in a way, but one of the searching
party was lost.”</p>

<p>“Drowned?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“As to that no one ever knew. He fell into
the water when the boat was wrecked, and none
of his friends ever saw him again. They had
a watch kept on the river below, but the body
was never seen. The man disappeared completely.
He was quite a friend of mine, too, in
a way, for we corresponded, and exchanged scientific
books, though I only saw him a few times.
Hartley Bentwell was his name, and he was one
of the best authorities on radium that I ever
heard of. I often wonder what became of him.
He gave his life up in the interests of science.”</p>

<p>“And do you really believe there is radium
there?” asked Ned, after a pause.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I do,” answered the professor
quietly. “I had the good fortune to see the
piece of mineral, containing some, that the prospector
picked up years ago. There was no doubt
but that it contained radium, for all the manifestations
were present. And if there was one bit
of radium on that island, there must be more.”</p>

<p>“Unless it’s all evaporated by this time,” put
in Bob.</p>

<p>“Radium doesn’t evaporate,” said the professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
with a smile. “The smallest piece you can
imagine, will give off what you might call ‘rays’
or ‘sparks’ for thousands of years, and, at the
end of that time, the most delicate scales would
show no loss of weight. It’s the same way with
pure musk. A grain of it has been known to
scent, say a box, or chest of drawers, for fifty
years, and, at the end of that time, the whole
grain of musk was still there.”</p>

<p>“That’s strange,” murmured Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s not nearly all the strange facts
about radium,” went on Mr. Snodgrass. “I
could talk to you for hours about it and not half
finish.”</p>

<p>“Tell us more about Snake Island,” suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s all I know,” and the professor closed
the book that had started the conversation. “I
only heard what I have told you. It was because
I was interested in Mr. Bentwell, and felt
his loss so much that the tale impressed me. I
often thought I would like to have a try for
that radium myself, not because of the fortune,
but because of the scientific value of the metal,
or mineral, whichever you choose to call it. But
I never seemed to get the time, and I had so
many other things to do, gathering——”</p>

<p>The professor suddenly stopped talking, and
made a dive for a certain spot on the carpet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
He came down on his hands and knees, holding
his palms together.</p>

<p>“I got it!” he cried triumphantly. “Ned,
please get my smallest insect case. It’s in my
right hand coat pocket,” and the scientist remained
on his knees, a look of joy on his face.</p>

<p>“Did you fall?” asked Bob innocently.</p>

<p>“No, indeed, I jumped,” replied the professor.
“As I was speaking I happened to see a
new variety of pink-winged moth fluttering on the
carpet, and as this moth——”</p>

<p>“Moths in my carpet!” cried Mrs. Slade, entering
the room at that moment. “Oh, Professor!
Let me kill it at once! Where is it?”</p>

<p>“I have it safe,” answered Mr. Snodgrass
with a smile. “As for killing it, I’ll do that, but
it must be carefully done, so as not to crush it.
Have you the box, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Yes, here it is,” and the lad drew out a
small, glass-topped case from the professor’s
pocket.</p>

<p>“Well, as long as you have the moth, I suppose
it can’t eat holes in my new carpet,” said
Mrs. Slade. “I must put some cedar oil around,
and kill the horrid things.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg of you, if you see any more to
save them for me!” implored the professor.
“There you are, my little pink beauty!” he exclaimed,
as he put the moth in the case where it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
soon died, for the box contained cyanide of potassium,
the fumes from which are almost instantly
fatal to insect life. “That is worth many
dollars to my college collection,” went on the
scientist. “I would not have missed that for the
world. This has been a lucky day for me. Let
me see, what was I talking about?” and he looked
at the boys through his powerful spectacles, while
he absent-mindedly brushed the dust from his
trousers.</p>

<p>“It was radium, and you said you’d like to
go to Snake Island,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, and I had told you about how my
friend lost his life seeking the place. Indeed I
would like to go, but I am afraid it is out of
the question. However, I suppose some one will
get the fortune some day,” and the professor
carefully put the insect box in his pocket, looking
the while, carefully over the carpet for more
specimens.</p>

<p>“Well, that surely was a queer yarn,” remarked
Bob. “I say, Ned, what do you say if
we have something to eat on it. I’m hungry,
and——”</p>

<p>“You don’t care who knows it!” finished
Jerry with a laugh.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” put in Ned good-naturedly,
for the chums were almost like brothers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
made themselves perfectly at home in each other’s
houses. “I guess it must be almost lunch time.
I’ll go see if it isn’t ready. I reckon we can all
eat some, even Professor Snodgrass, if he can
spare the time from his specimens.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” laughed the scientist. “I am
ready——”</p>

<p>At that moment there came an interruption
in the shape of a small boy, very excited, and out
of breath, who dashed up on the porch, on which
opened the library windows of the room where
the three chums and the professor had been
talking.</p>

<p>“Whoop!” yelled the small lad.</p>

<p>“Andy Rush!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Wow!” yelled Andy, getting his second
wind. “Come on, fellows—’sawful—dam’s
busted—river’s got loose—houses being washed
away—people in the water—dogs—chickens—boats—fearful—terrible
excitement—come on—don’t
lose a minute—the whole place may go—big
flood—whoop—come on—don’t wait—wow!”</p>

<p>For a moment the three chums gazed at the
excited small lad. Then Jerry asked, sternly:</p>

<p>“Andy, is this true, or are you joking?”</p>

<p>“True? Of course it’s true! Come on—rescue—big
damage—dam’s busted—save lives!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fellows, I guess we’d better go!” cried
Jerry, and, followed by his chums, and the professor,
he rushed from the room, Andy coming
after, and giving vent to excited whoops at every
other breath.</p>

<small>THE SAVING OF NODDY</small></h2>


<p>“How did it happen, Andy?” asked Jerry, as
he ran along.</p>

<p>“Yes, tell us more about it,” urged Bob.</p>

<p>“Is it the big reservoir dam that’s broken?”
asked Ned. “If it is, there’ll be a lot of damage,
and yet I don’t hear any great excitement,”
and he paused a moment to listen if he could
catch the roar of rushing waters. But there
came no unusual sound from the direction of the
river which bordered the town of Cresville, where
the boys lived.</p>

<p>“I don’t know—didn’t see it!” panted Andy.
“Old Pete Bumps told me—said it was the dam—terrible—everything
washed away—come on—wow!”</p>

<p>“Oh, if it was old Pete Bumps, our hired man,
who told you, it can’t be so bad,” returned Bob
Baker. “Pete always makes a big fuss over
everything. Let’s take it easy, fellows.”</p>

<p>“You can’t tell,” interposed Jerry. “Something
must have happened. I see a lot of fellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
running toward the river,” and he nodded toward
a side street, through which could be had a
glimpse of a thoroughfare parallel to the one on
which our friends were, both extending to the
stream. “Come on,” finished the tall lad.
“We’ll see what it is,” and he increased his pace,
his companions doing likewise.</p>

<p>While I have just a few moments before the
boys reach the river, and in which time they are
doing nothing but running, and wondering what
has happened, I will take the opportunity to tell
you something about the chums, and the various
books, previous to this one, in which they have
figured.</p>

<p>The first volume of the series entitled, “The
Motor Boys,” told how the chums got together,
and entered a bicycle race. Later on they got
motor-cycles, and then an automobile in which
they had many adventures. They took a long
trip overland, got possession of a gold mine, and
later went to Mexico, where they were in great
danger. But they managed to escape, and, on
a long trip across the plains they rescued the
hermit of Lost Lake.</p>

<p>After these adventures, our heroes decided that
motor boating would suit them, and they succeeded
in getting a fine craft. In the volume
named, “The Motor Boys Afloat,” is told how
the lads cruised in the <i>Dartaway</i>, and succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
in finding the robbers who had broken into Mr.
Slade’s department store.</p>

<p>The lads liked motor boating so well that
they took a cruise on the Atlantic, during which
they solved the mystery of the lighthouse, and,
later on, they went to the strange waters of the
Florida Everglades.</p>

<p>Naturally, after their adventures on the Atlantic,
they turned their attention to the other
ocean, the Pacific, and there they succeeded in
locating a lost derelict.</p>

<p>By this time the science of navigating the air
was becoming better known, and aeroplanes and
dirigible balloons were being perfected. It
could not be expected that such lads as the motor
boys could be kept from this field of activity, and
with the assistance of an old balloonist of experience,
Rupert Glassford, Bob, Ned and Jerry
built a motorship. In the book called “The
Motor Boys in the Clouds,” I told how they made
a great trip for fame and fortune, and, some time
later they went over the Rocky Mountains, and
solved the mystery of the air.</p>

<p>Thrilling indeed were the adventures that happened
next, for when they made their voyage
over the ocean they succeeded in rescuing from
mid-air a certain Mr. Jackson, who was trying
out a new kind of balloon. He and his crew
were rendered unconscious by escaping gas, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
they were brought around all right after hard
work.</p>

<p>In the next book, “The Motor Boys on the
Wing,” I told how the three chums sought and
found the bank robbers, and recovered the stolen
money. They had been home from this trip
some little time, when the incident narrated in
the first chapter of the present volume took
place.</p>

<p>I might add that the three chums lived in the
town of Cresville, not far from Boston. Their
names you are already familiar with. Bob
Baker, the fat lad, was the son of Mr. Andrew
Baker, a well-known banker. Ned Slade’s
father was Aaron Slade, a wealthy department
store owner, while Jerry Hopkins was the son
of a rich widow, Mrs. Julia Hopkins. The three
lads were about the same age, full of fun, grit and
the love of adventure.</p>

<p>Many times, though, their fun was spoiled by
a mean, bullying lad of the town, Noddy Nixon
by name, and his crony, Bill Berry. But the
motor boys generally managed to get the best of
Noddy in the end. In this they were sometimes
aided by Andy Rush, the excitable little chap,
who had given the alarm about the bursting dam.
Andy was always excited, and sometimes by the
slightest cause.</p>

<p>Professor Uriah Snodgrass was a well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
scientist. He often went with the boys on their
trips, and he was continually on the lookout for
rare bugs, or other specimens. He was employed
by a well-known college, to get various
articles for its museum, and often the professor
would do odd things for the sake of getting a
choice insect or reptile. He was a great friend
of the boys, and often visited them at their
houses. He had spent some time with Mr.
Slade, who was one of the trustees of the college
to which the professor was attached, and Mr.
Snodgrass was about to return to his duties when,
in a talk with Ned, the conversation turned to
radium, as I have mentioned. But now all
thoughts of that, and of Snake Island, were forgotten
in the alarm raised by Andy.</p>

<p>“What do you think can have happened, anyhow?”
asked Ned, as he raced along beside
Jerry.</p>

<p>“I give it up; but it’s something, anyhow,”
was the tall lad’s answer, “and that, in spite of
the fact that you’ve usually got to discount what
Andy says. Look at the crowd!”</p>

<p>As Jerry spoke he and the others reached the
end of the street, and came in sight of the river.
They could see that something out of the ordinary
was taking place, but the stream did not
seem to be unusually high, though it had risen
somewhat on account of heavy spring rains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“The big dam hasn’t burst, or we’d hear the
roar of waters,” declared Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, and we’d see ’em, too,” added Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, something busted, because Pete Bumps
told me!” insisted Andy. “Maybe the bottom
dropped out of the river—water may be all running
away—ground sunk in—we’ll all fall
through—whoop!”</p>

<p>“Andy!” cried Jerry. “Stop, or you’ll
burst! Cool down; can’t you?”</p>

<p>“I can’t seem to,” answered the small lad.
“Hey!” he cried, “there goes one house, anyhow,”
and he pointed to a structure floating down
the stream.</p>

<p>“That’s so!” agreed Bob. “It’s a boathouse,
too. I wonder what’s up?”</p>

<p>They saw a moment later. Just above where
the street on which they were running came out
on the river front, was a small stream that joined
the main one. This little stream had been
dammed up, to provide a flow of water for an
old-fashioned iron mill that used a turbine wheel.
Part of this mill-dam had given way because of
the heavy rains, and the waters that were held
back had suddenly been released, to flow into the
river proper.</p>

<p>There was quite a crowd collected on the both
banks of the river, and employees from the mill
were endeavoring to repair the break in the dam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
by putting timbers in it, and filling in the gap
with stones, sod and earth.</p>

<p>“Say, this isn’t such an awful flood!” cried
Jerry as he took in the scene. “I thought you
said the whole town was being washed away,
Andy?”</p>

<p>“And you said houses were being carried
down,” added Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s one house washed away, anyhow,”
declared the small, excitable chap, as if
to justify himself.</p>

<p>“That’s so!” cried Bob, “and it’s Noddy
Nixon’s boathouse. It’s been washed away, and
it’s going right down the river.”</p>

<p>“It didn’t take much to wash it away,” said
Jerry. “It was built too far out in the water,
anyhow, and the piles it stood on weren’t much
bigger than clothes poles. I always thought it
would wash away if the water got high, and now
it has.”</p>

<p>Noddy Nixon had recently built a new boathouse
on a piece of land near the river. It was
just below the mill dam, and, naturally, when
the rush of waters came, the structure was carried
away, for it was not securely built. It was
now floating down the stream, careening from
side to side in the rushing waters.</p>

<p>“Somebody ought to save that boathouse!”
cried Andy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let Noddy do it then,” answered Jerry.
“It isn’t worth an awful lot, and it will be worth
less when this flood gets through with it.”</p>

<p>“Look!” suddenly exclaimed Ned. “Some
one is in the boathouse!”</p>

<p>He pointed toward it, and, at the same time
a cry arose from the crowds on either bank.</p>

<p>“Some one’s in the house!” was the shout.
“He’ll be drowned!”</p>

<p>“It’s a man!” yelled Andy.</p>

<p>“It’s Noddy himself!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>The figure on the narrow platform in front of
the floating boathouse could now be plainly seen.
It was that of Noddy, as Bob had said, and the
bully who had been endeavoring, by means of a
long pole, to push his house toward shore, now
threw up his hands, and cried for help.</p>

<p>“It’s time he did that before,” commented
Ned. “The current’s got him now, and he’ll
never get that house to land.”</p>

<p>“Where was he all this while?” asked Bob.
“I didn’t notice him at first.”</p>

<p>“Guess he must have been on the other side,
out of sight,” spoke Jerry.</p>

<p>Noddy was now frantically rushing up and
down, calling at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>“Help! Help!”</p>

<p>“Say!” suddenly cried Ned. “The rapids!
He’ll be down in them soon, and they’re dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
with the water as high as it is now! That
house will be knocked to pieces!”</p>

<p>“That’s so!” agreed Jerry. “Noddy ought
to swim ashore while he has the chance. Otherwise
he may be hurt! I forgot about the rapids.”</p>

<p>The “rapids” were really not very dangerous
at low water, but when the river rose, and dashed
over the jagged rocks, about a mile below town,
they formed eddies and whirlpools that were exceedingly
risky to navigate. In fact no boats
dare risk them with the stream at flood.</p>

<p>It was toward these rapids that Noddy’s boathouse,
torn away by the waters, was rapidly drifting.
The crowd soon realized this and began
shouting advice.</p>

<p>“Swim ashore!”</p>

<p>“Get a boat and save him!”</p>

<p>“Jump off!”</p>

<p>“Throw him a rope!”</p>

<p>These were some of the expressions called to
Noddy, but he paid no heed to them, continuing
to race up and down on the platform, waving
his hands, and yelling for help.</p>

<p>“Say, something ought to be done to help
him,” remarked Ned in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Jerry. “It’s Noddy Nixon,
and he’s been pretty mean to us, but I suppose——”</p>

<p>“Our motor boat!” interrupted Bob, pointing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
to a fine boathouse a little distance up the
stream. It was where the boys kept their craft,
and was above the point where the swollen mill
stream joined the river, and so, consequently,
was in no danger.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s up to us to save him,” said Jerry
slowly. “Nobody else seems to have sense
enough to do it. There aren’t any other motor
boats near by.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Noddy’s, I wonder?” asked Mr.
Snodgrass, for he knew that the bully owned a
power craft.</p>

<p>“He had a collision with the dock the other
day, and sprung a leak,” explained Andy Rush,
who had cooled down somewhat. “His boat is
laid up for repairs.”</p>

<p>“Like our auto,” put in Ned, for the machine
of our heroes was across the river, in a distant
town, being overhauled.</p>

<p>“Well, if we’re going to save Noddy Nixon,
we’d better be getting a move on!” cried Jerry.
“Come on, fellows!”</p>

<p>He raced toward their boathouse, followed by
his two chums, the professor and Andy Rush.
It was the work of but a few minutes to unchain
the motor boat, run it out into the stream, start
the engine and steer down after the floating
boathouse with the frantic figure racing about
on the platform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hurrah!” yelled the crowd, when they saw
our heroes start out. “The motor boys to the
rescue! Noddy’ll be saved now, all right!”</p>

<p>“Help! Help!” yelled the bully, as his boathouse
careened dangerously, almost throwing him
into the water.</p>

<p>“The flood’s getting higher,” said Ned in a
low voice, as he looked over the side of the boat.
They were opposite the dam now, and in the
grip of the rushing waters.</p>

<p>“Yes, there goes another slice of the dam!”
cried Bob, as they saw a large portion of it slip
into the water. The men on top, who had been
endeavoring to stop the gap, had to race for shore.</p>

<p>“Say, we’re going to have our work cut out
for us saving Noddy!” cried Jerry as he held the
wheel in a firmer grasp.</p>

<small>NODDY BEGINS PLOTTING</small></h2>


<p>“Ned, give me a little richer mixture!” cried
Jerry, as the motor boat shot down the current,
pitching and rolling in the waves caused by the
influx of the mill stream. “I need all the power
I can get. Cut down the air a bit, and turn on a
little more gasolene!”</p>

<p>Ned bent over the carburetor, and adjusted it,
while Jerry watched his own steering to see that
he did not run the boat into the many floating
logs and boards that had been carried into the
river by the flood.</p>

<p>“Need any help?” sung out Bob.</p>

<p>“Not up here, but I wish you’d sit on the
other side, Chunky,” replied the steersman, giving
Bob the nickname that had been applied to
him because of his stoutness. “That will trim
the boat better, and she’ll ride easier. Professor,
would you mind moving up nearer the stern.
I want to get the bow as high as I can.”</p>

<p>“Just a moment!” exclaimed the scientist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
“I thought I saw a new kind of water spider.
Yes, there it is! Hold the boat back a moment,
Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Can’t do it!” cried the tall lad. “This
current is fierce!”</p>

<p>The professor suddenly made a lunge over the
side with outstretched hands, and the boat careened
dangerously.</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’ve got him!” answered the professor.
“Oh, it’s a fine specimen! I never had one so
good. Where’s my spider-box?” and with one
hand tightly clasped, holding the water insect,
the scientist, with the other, began searching in
his pockets for the box to contain his prize.</p>

<p>“I’ll get it for you,” volunteered Bob.</p>

<p>“It’s in my left hand coat pocket,” said the
professor.</p>

<p>The insect was soon in captivity and then, as
the boat shot ahead under increased power, due
to the change in the gasolene mixture, all on board
gazed at the floating boathouse, and the unfortunate
owner of it, who was still rushing about,
unable to do anything to help himself.</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Andy. “It’s going to flop
over!”</p>

<p>It did seem as if the structure would turn turtle,
but a swirl in the current righted it, and
once more it floated on a level keel, so to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Help! Help!” cried Noddy, waving his
hands at the boys in the motor boat.</p>

<p>“We’re coming!” shouted Ned. “Keep
cool!”</p>

<p>“Wow! Steady! We’ll save you—don’t
jump—it’s all right—not as bad as it might be—hold
fast!” excitedly cried Andy Rush.</p>

<p>“Keep still!” ordered Jerry. “You’ll have
him jumping overboard next, Andy.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed the little lad, sitting down
on the cushions, and holding to the rail to keep
his nerves in control.</p>

<p>The motor boat was now well down the flooded
river, and aided by the current and her engine,
was rapidly approaching the floating boathouse.
The latter structure was whirling about, careening
from side to side, now on one edge of the
stream, and now on the other.</p>

<p>“It’ll soon be in the rapids,” spoke Ned in a
low voice.</p>

<p>“We’ll get there before that,” said Jerry confidently.</p>

<p>“How you going to get him off?” asked Bob.
“Run along side and have him jump, or make
fast?”</p>

<p>“I’m certainly not going to make fast to that
house,” replied Jerry. “It would pull us over
the rocks, I’m afraid. I guess Noddy will have
to jump, and swim for it. Then we can pick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
him up. Ned, stand ready with that life preserver,
and see that it’s fast to the rope.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” answered Ned, seaman fashion.</p>

<p>He made ready the cork ring, with its accompanying
line, and took his place in the bow,
ready to cast it when Jerry should give the word
for Noddy to jump. The lad on the boathouse
platform was standing, and looking at the approaching
motor craft, waving his hands frantically,
and occasionally calling for help.</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t he keep still?” spoke Jerry.
“We’re coming as fast as we can.”</p>

<p>“Better not go much nearer,” advised Ned.
“I can hear the roar of the rapids. They’re
just around that turn.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to tell him to jump now,” said
Jerry. “He’s a pretty good swimmer, and he
can keep afloat until we can pick him up. Get
ready with that ring, Ned.”</p>

<p>“All ready!”</p>

<p>Jerry stood up, and, bracing one knee against
the wheel, to aid his hands in holding it steady, he
shouted:</p>

<p>“Jump, Noddy! Jump! We’ll pick you up!
Jump!”</p>

<p>“I—I’m afraid to,” whimpered the bully.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to!” yelled the tall steersman
determinedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“I—I——” Noddy looked as though he were
going to slump down on his knees, but a sudden
swirl of the current saved him the necessity of
jumping, for he was thrown off the slanting platform
into the water.</p>

<p>“There he goes!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“The ring! The ring! Throw him the
ring!” shouted Jerry.</p>

<p>As Noddy went under the swirling waters,
Ned leaped out on the bow deck of the boat,
with the ring in his hand, watching for the reappearance
of the bully.</p>

<p>“There he is!” cried Andy Rush.</p>

<p><a href="#image02">With sure aim Ned sent the life preserver toward
Noddy.</a> It fell true, almost over his head,
and, a moment later, he had grasped it with a
desperation born of despair.</p>

TOWARD NODDY.</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Pull him in!” ordered Jerry, and Ned and
Bob began hauling on the line. A few seconds
later, half unconscious, pale, and with closed eyes,
Noddy was pulled on board.</p>

<p>“He’s dead!” cried Andy.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Jerry, as he began
to turn the boat toward shore. “He wasn’t in
the water more than three minutes. He’s fainted,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“Better get him to shore as soon as possible,”
suggested Professor Snodgrass. “He may have
been injured.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m heading for that dock over there,” remarked
Jerry, pointing to one on the Cresville
side of the river. “We can lay him out there,
and give first aid to the injured, and, if he’s swallowed
any water, we can drain it out of him.
Keep his head low and his feet high, fellows,”
he said to Bob and Ned, who were holding
Noddy. The rescued lad had not opened his
eyes.</p>

<p>It was a hard fight against the powerful current
of the flooded river to gain the dock, but Jerry
made it, for the engine of our heroes’ craft was a
fine one.</p>

<p>“Get him out now!” cried the tall lad, as he
made the boat fast on the lower side of the
dock, where the swirl of the river would not
affect it. “Use artificial respiration.”</p>

<p>The motor boys knew how to do this, and in
a little while they saw that Noddy was breathing
more strongly. It developed later that he had
been hit on the head by a piece of driftwood,
rendering him partly unconscious, so that he swallowed
more water than he would ordinarily have
done.</p>

<p>“I guess he’s coming around all right now,”
said Ned, as he noticed a fluttering of Noddy’s
eyelids.</p>

<p>“Here comes Dr. Preston!” added Bob, as
he saw a young man, accompanied by a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
throng of persons, racing toward the dock.
“He’ll know what to do.”</p>

<p>Dr. Preston, who had been summoned by some
one of the crowd who had witnessed the rescue,
was soon working over Noddy.</p>

<p>“He’s out of danger now, though he’s not fully
conscious yet,” said the doctor, after a few minutes.
“It’s a wonder he had strength enough to
hold on to the ring as you pulled him in.”</p>

<p>“Well, when Noddy gets hold of a thing, he
hates to let go,” remarked Ned. “Say, fellows,”
he added to his two chums, “a lot has happened
since we started to talk about that radium deposit
on Snake Island, in the Colorado canyon; hasn’t
there?” he asked. “It seems like a week, but
it hasn’t been half an hour.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Bob. “I want to hear
more about that radium. Let’s go back home,
and the Professor can tell us. Noddy’s all right
now. If we could go to Snake Island and get
some radium——”</p>

<p>“Hush!” suddenly exclaimed Jerry, nudging
his chum.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” demanded the stout
youth.</p>

<p>“No use talking about that, where every one
can hear you,” went on Jerry in a low voice.
“Besides, Noddy is coming to, now. His eyes
are open.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>The rescued lad was much better now, and
was sitting up, held by the doctor, who was administering
a stimulant.</p>

<p>“That’s so, I guess I had better keep quiet,”
admitted Bob in a low voice.</p>

<p>Quite a crowd had collected on the dock, and
one man, who had a carriage, offered to take
Noddy home. This was decided on, and soon,
in the care of the physician, the bully was taken
away. He had not recovered sufficiently to
thank his rescuers, but the motor boys felt that
the less they had to do with Noddy the better for
them. They had done their duty, and were content
to let it go at that.</p>

<p>“Think we can go up against the current?”
asked Ned of Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to try it. The river will soon
go down, for the water in the mill pond will all
be out by night. We’ll just leave our boat tied
up here. No use taking any chances on hitting
a floating log, and stoving a hole in the <i>Dartaway</i>.
We’ll come down and get her to-night.”</p>

<p>The motor boys made their way out of the
crowd, from the members of which came murmurs
of praise at the plucky act of our heroes.
Noddy’s boathouse disappeared around the bend
of the stream, and, a little later, was pounded to
pieces in the rapids.</p>

<p>The three chums, with the professor and Andy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Rush, made their way back to Ned’s house, talking
on the way of what had happened.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s all over,” remarked Ned, as they
came opposite the broken dam. “See, the pond
is almost emptied. They can mend the break
now. That was an exciting time while it lasted.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed the others.</p>

<p>“Let’s get that lunch we were starting on when
Andy interrupted us,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“Chunky, you’re hopeless!” cried Jerry.
“You’d eat if the world was coming to an end,
I believe.”</p>

<p>“I would if I had time,” admitted the fat lad.
“But there’s no use letting the lunch spoil; is
there, Ned?” and he appealed to his other chum.</p>

<p>“No, I guess not,” agreed the merchant’s
son. “Come on, Andy, have a bite with us,
but don’t you get excited or you may choke on
a piece of custard pie.”</p>

<p>“And while we’re eating maybe Professor
Snodgrass will tell us more about the radium on
Snake Island,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“I think I’ve told you all that I know,” replied
the scientist, “but you may ask me any questions
you like,” and, shortly afterward, while still at
the table, the little man was fairly bombarded
with inquiries about radium, its general properties,
and in particular about the kind that was to
be found on Snake Island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Noddy was taken home, and
nursed. He was weak and ill, but this did not
prevent him, as he lay in bed, from doing some
hard thinking.</p>

<p>“Radium; that was what those motor boys
were talking of,” he murmured to himself, as
he felt of the bandage on his head. “Radium on
some place in a canyon. Canyon—canyon—Grand
Canyon. I wonder where that is? Radium;
I know that stuff. It’s worth millions—but
that canyon—Oh, I know—the Grand Canyon
of the Colorado! That’s it. Snake Island!
That must be a place in the river. I wonder
if I could find it?”</p>

<p>Noddy dozed off for a moment. Suddenly he
sat up in bed.</p>

<p>“I’m going to do it!” he exclaimed. “There’s
no reason why they should have it! I’ll get
ahead of them! I’ve got as good a right to it as
they have!”</p>

<p>He was in deep thought for a minute.</p>

<p>“That college professor knows about it,” he
resumed. “And if he knows, other scientists
know too. Radium is used in colleges for experiments.
I’ll do it! I’ll get Bill Berry, and
we’ll find some other college professor, and start
after that radium ourselves. I’ll get ahead of
the motor boys for once in my life! Radium!
It may be worth millions!” and Noddy’s eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
gleamed as he unfolded to himself the plot he
was hatching against our heroes.</p>

<p>“I’ll start as soon as I can,” he went on. “It
isn’t very far to that Colorado canyon. That’s
what I’ll do. Me and Bill will get that radium.
I guess I can find Snake Island as well as Jerry,
Ned or Bob. They didn’t think I heard them,
but I did. I just kept my eyes shut. Oh, I’ll
fool ’em!”</p>

<p>And, mean bully that he was, forgetting that
the motor boys had saved his life, Noddy Nixon
began making plans for going to Snake Island
after the deposit of radium, which was worth
such a fortune.</p>

<small>PLANNING A FORTUNE HUNT</small></h2>


<p>“Well, I feel better now,” remarked Bob
with a sigh of satisfaction, as he pushed back
his chair from the table.</p>

<p>“You look better, too,” spoke Jerry, with a
laugh. “You haven’t that worn and hungry appearance
you had a while ago, and I guess the
rest of us can have a little peace now.”</p>

<p>“Peace? What do you mean?” demanded
the stout youth indignantly.</p>

<p>“I mean that you won’t continually be talking
about something to eat.”</p>

<p>“I guess you were hungry, too,” went on Bob.
“I notice that your plate is empty.”</p>

<p>“Here, you two quit scrapping,” advised Ned
good-naturedly. “I guess we were all hungry.
It was the excitement over rescuing Noddy that
caused it.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” chimed in Andy Rush.
“Whoop! That was exciting all right. Let’s
go back and see if they’ve got the busted dam
mended—maybe there’s a lot of men drowned—maybe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
we can see where Noddy’s boathouse went
to pieces in the rapids—wow—some excitement
all right—I’m going—come on, fellows!”</p>

<p>“No, we’ve got business on hand,” answered
Ned, a bit soberly. “But don’t let us keep you,
Andy.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’m going—I like excitement—maybe
they’ll let me help mend the dam,” and
taking Ned’s words as a sort of gentle hint, the
excitable little lad arose from the table and was
soon hurrying down the street.</p>

<p>“I guess they’ll keep him away from the dam
if they know what’s good for it,” remarked
Jerry, as he watched Andy hurrying away.
“He might talk so much that he’d put another
hole in it. But what business did you mean,
Ned?” and he looked across at his chum.</p>

<p>“The radium business, of course,” returned
Ned promptly. “You fellows don’t mean to say
you’re going to let a chance like this slip!”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Bob, “do you intend to go
after it, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m willing, if you and Jerry are, and
if the professor would like to go along——”</p>

<p>“Go where?” asked Uriah Snodgrass, looking
up from a scientific book he had started to
read as soon as the meal was over. “Where
do you want me to go?”</p>

<p>“After the radium on Snake Island,” put in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Jerry. “Ned thinks we can get it, but I don’t
know that it’s possible, after what you have told
us about how hard it is to get down into the
Grand Canyon.”</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> hard,” said the professor seriously. “I
haven’t in the least made up my mind to go on
the expedition, but whoever does go, ought not to
risk going in a boat, as the other scientists did.
It is almost certain death. I really don’t know
how one could make the descent into the canyon.
The island, as I understand it, is in the middle
of the river, near a place where there are dangerous
rapids and whirlpools. The cliffs on either
bank of the stream are impossible to scale.</p>

<p>“Of course at certain points it is possible to
make a descent into that great canyon. I remember
reading an article on it and it stated that there
were several trails that could be used, Bright Angel
Trail is one, and then there are Bass’s, Boucher’s,
Berry’s and the Red Canyon Trail. Berry’s is
near Grand View, as it’s called, and Snake Island
lies somewhere between that point and Bright
Angel Trail. Oh, a boat is out of the question,
I think.”</p>

<p>“Then what’s the matter with our airship?”
asked Ned quickly.</p>

<p>“That’s it!” cried Bob eagerly. “Why
didn’t we think of that before? We’ll go in the
airship, fellows, and get that radium! It will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
be just the thing! Here it is almost vacation
time, school will close in a couple of weeks, and
that will be our summer outing—to go after the
radium fortune in our airship.”</p>

<p>“You forget that the airship is in Denver,”
put in Jerry. “You know we loaned it to Mr.
Glassford to give an exhibition at the international
aero meet, and in his last letter he said he has
won several prizes with it.”</p>

<p>“But the meet is over; isn’t it?” asked Ned,
who seemed unusually excited over the prospective
trip.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I suppose Mr. Glassford will soon
be sending our motorship back,” admitted Jerry.
“But——”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t go to finding a lot of objections,”
broke in Bob. “What’s the matter with leaving
the airship out in Denver?”</p>

<p>“And walk out there to use it?” inquired the
tall lad sarcastically.</p>

<p>“No, motor out there. Our auto will soon be
out of the repair shop, and we could have a fine
time going West in it. Say, things couldn’t happen
better; could they, Professor?” and Bob began
pacing up and down the room.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” asked the scientist
suddenly, for he had again become absorbed in
his book, and had paid no attention to the talk
of the boys. “Is anything the matter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’re still talking radium,” explained Ned.
“Trying to get Jerry enthused enough to go to
Snake Island.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll go if the rest of you do,” agreed the
widow’s son. “Only it doesn’t sound feasible.
Our airship isn’t at hand, the motor is laid up
for repairs, and——”</p>

<p>“But we have the motor boat,” broke in Ned.
“We can use that.”</p>

<p>“On dry land!” laughed Jerry. “Say, you
fellows have great ideas—great!”</p>

<p>“Give us some of yours then,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, my notion is——”</p>

<p>“I’ve got it! I’ve got it!” fairly yelled Professor
Snodgrass, leaping from his chair, and
holding the book above his head. “I’ve got it!”</p>

<p>“What is it this time?” asked Jerry. “A
pink-eyed toad or a blue-nosed grasshopper?”
for the scientist was continually on the lookout
for strange and rare insects or reptiles.</p>

<p>“Neither one,” answered Mr. Snodgrass,
“but I have just found, in this book, an article
telling about a strange double-tailed toad, very
rare, which is said to be a native of New Mexico.
It is a species of the horned toad, but very different.
For years I have been investigating, trying
to get on the trail of this sort of toad, and now,
most unexpectedly, I come upon a clew. Boys,
this has indeed been a fortunate day for me. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
shall start right away for New Mexico. I must
telegraph the college president at once that I can
get a most valuable specimen to add to our collection.
Oh, this is indeed fortunate!”</p>

<p>The professor was rapidly making notes from
the article in the book. The boys looked at one
another. Then Ned spoke.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” he said, “this just fits in. New
Mexico is on the way to the Grand Canyon—or
at least it won’t be much out of our way to go
there. We can have a try for the radium fortune
and at the same time the professor can look
for his tailless toad. How about it?”</p>

<p>“Two-tailed toad! Two-tailed!” cried the
little scientist. “Don’t make that mistake, Ned.
But I think that will be a good plan. I was undecided
about it before, but, since you are going,
I will go with you, and I’ll do all I can to help
you get to Snake Island.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll help hunt the two-tailed toad,”
added Bob. “Now, how about you, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m game. I’ll go along, but we’ve got
to straighten out about our auto and motorship.
First we’ll write to Mr. Glassford, asking him to
hold the <i>Comet</i> in Denver for us. Then we must
hurry the repairs on the auto.”</p>

<p>Mr. Glassford, as my old readers probably remember,
was the man who first helped our heroes
to construct their motorship. He had recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
borrowed their latest and largest craft for exhibition
purposes.</p>

<p>“Well, get busy,” advised Ned. “Here is
some paper. Take my fountain pen and write
some letters. It’s decided then; we’ll have a try
for the radium, and we’ve got to get a move on
to get ready.”</p>

<p>“Here comes the postman,” spoke Bob. “I’ll
get the mail, Ned.”</p>

<p>The stout lad came back with several letters.
One was for Ned Slade. He quickly tore it open,
and, as he read it he gave a startled cry.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter—bad news?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Sort of that way,” replied his chum. “This
letter is from the man who was repairing our
auto. He says he discovered a flaw in the back
axle, and, in order to have a new one properly
fitted in he sent the car to Pittsburg, where there
is a firm that makes a specialty of such things.
Our auto is in Pittsburg!”</p>

<p>“Then it’s all up with using it on the trip
west!” exclaimed Jerry. “We’ll have to go by
train I guess.”</p>

<p>“No we won’t!” cried Bob eagerly. “Fellows,
I’ve got a plan.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>NODDY’S PLOT DEVELOPS</small></h2>


<p>There was a moment of silence following
Bob’s announcement. Then Jerry remarked:</p>

<p>“Well, go ahead, Chunky, and let’s see what
you’ve got up your sleeve. Are you going to suggest
a wireless airship ride, or a motorless
auto?”</p>

<p>“Neither one,” said Bob. “But I was going
to say I didn’t see why we couldn’t go in our motor
boat as far as Pittsburg, pick up the auto
there, when it’s finished, go on in that to Denver,
get the airship and then keep on to Snake Island.
I think——”</p>

<p>“Say, that’s all to the ice cream!” burst out
Ned. “Bob, you have got a head on your
shoulders after all. That’s a fine idea, I think.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” agreed Jerry. “But can we go all
the way to Pittsburg by water?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” declared Bob. “Where’s a map?
Ned, hunt up a geography.” One was soon found
and then the boys, bending over it, saw that by
using the river that flowed past their town for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
number of miles, getting into a little lake, and
thence into another river, they could, by means
of a small canal get into a small river flowing into
the Alleghany.</p>

<p>“We’d have to have the boat carted about five
miles, but all the rest of the way we can go by
water,” explained Bob. “As soon as we hit the
Alleghany we’ll be all right. What do you say,
Professor?”</p>

<p>“Anything you boys decide on will suit me,”
answered the scientist, who was still busy making
notes. “I want to get that two-tailed toad, and
I’ll do anything in reason to secure a specimen.
It strikes me that Bob’s plan is a good one.”</p>

<p>“It won’t be monotonous, at any rate,” commented
Ned. “A motor boat, an auto and an
aeroplane and dirigible balloon combined, ought
to furnish a variety of travel that would suit almost
any one. I think it’s just the cheese, myself.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll do it,” decided Jerry. “I’ll write
to Mr. Glassford, and the auto firm right away,
and we can mail the letters on our way home,
Bob. I’ve got to be going soon. I told mother
I’d go calling with her this afternoon, but I’ve
been here nearly all day.”</p>

<p>The letters were soon written, and then Jerry
and Bob taking leave of Ned, started for their
homes. Professor Snodgrass also sent word of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the prospective trip to the college authorities by
whom he was engaged. The scientist arranged to
stay at Ned’s house until the time of starting.</p>

<p>“Let’s go have a look at the broken dam,”
proposed Bob when Jerry had dropped the letters
in the box. Accordingly they went a short
distance out of their way, down to the river.
The excitement of the morning had passed, and
there was only a small crowd watching the mill
men at work. The waters had now subsided, but
it would be some time before the dam would be
in shape to again hold back the stream, and provide
power for the turbine.</p>

<p>“It was a hot time while it lasted,” remarked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“It sure was,” agreed his chum. “I wonder
how Noddy is getting on?”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, I guess. He’s so tough it takes
a good deal to hurt him. I suppose we’ll hear
from his folks.”</p>

<p>The motor boys did, a few days later, Mr.
Nixon sending Bob, Ned and Jerry a formal note
of thanks for what they had done for his son.
Noddy was getting on all right, his father said,
and would soon be out of bed. From Noddy
himself no word came.</p>

<p>“I don’t wish him any bad luck,” spoke Ned,
“but I hope he stays in bed a couple of weeks.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“So he won’t have a chance to interfere with
us. I’d like to get started on our radium trip before
he’s up and nosing around.”</p>

<p>“Why, he doesn’t even know we’re thinking of
it,” put in Bob. “How can he interfere?”</p>

<p>“Well, somehow or other, he has always, more
or less, made trouble for us whenever we go off
on trips,” went on Ned. “I don’t know how it is,
but it generally happens. Maybe this will be an
exception.”</p>

<p>“How soon before we can start?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“Not for a couple of weeks,” replied Jerry.
“School closes a week from to-day, and then it
will take us a week to get ready after that. We
haven’t much time now, on account of examinations.
I’ve got to do some hard studying to
pass.”</p>

<p>“So have I,” admitted Bob. “Well, then,
we’ll say in a couple of weeks. Maybe Noddy
won’t be around by then, and we’ll be all right.
Did you hear from Mr. Glassford, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he says he’ll have the <i>Comet</i> all
ready for us. He won’t be there himself, as he
has to come east, but he’s paid a man to take
charge of the motorship for us. The auto will
be ready in two weeks, also, for I had a letter
from the factory where they’re repairing it. I
wrote to ’em to make a few changes in it, to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
it up to date. Our motor boat, the <i>Dartaway</i>,
needs a little overhauling, and then that will be in
shape.”</p>

<p>Following the smashing of the original <i>Dartaway</i>
in the freight wreck, the boys had bought a
much larger and finer craft, with a cabin, and had
named it after their first boat.</p>

<p>Their auto I have described in previous books.
It was a large touring car, with plenty of room
for the passengers and also compartments where
food and supplies could be carried, and also a
small tent with folding cots, so that in case they
desired they could camp out wherever night overtook
them. Recently a closed body had been put
on the car, so that it was very comfortable to
travel in, even during a storm.</p>

<p>The motorship <i>Comet</i> I have also described in
other books, so I will only mention it briefly here.
It was a combination of an aeroplane and dirigible
balloon, and could be used as either or both.</p>

<p>The gas used in the bag was manufactured on
board, as needed, and there was a comfortable
cabin, sleeping berths and an engine room, fairly
filled with motors, dynamos, air pumps, a gas
generator and many other mechanical contrivances.
The motorship could be kept aloft a
number of days, and plenty of food and supplies
could be carried, in addition to several passengers.
It was an ideal craft of the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>In the days that followed the motor boys were
kept busy. When they were not “boning” away
over their lessons they were getting the <i>Dartaway</i>
in readiness for the trip. Professor Snodgrass
remained as the guest of Mr. Slade, and the
scientist spent most of his time wandering about
the woods and fields looking for rare bugs.</p>

<p>“I’m just as anxious to start as you boys are,”
he said to them one day, when he had paid a
visit to the dock where the boat was tied up, and
where Bob, Ned and Jerry were cleaning the engine,
and overhauling the mechanism.</p>

<p>“Well, it won’t be long now,” remarked
Jerry. “To-morrow ends school, and then—for
the best vacation we ever had!”</p>

<p>“And the radium fortune!” added Bob.</p>

<p>“Hush!” suddenly exclaimed the tall lad.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Did you see Noddy
Nixon?”</p>

<p>“No, but there’s his crony, Bill Berry, in that
boat,” and Jerry nodded toward a rowing craft
which a shabbily dressed man was propelling up
stream. “He’s pretending to be fishing,” went
on Jerry in a low voice, “but I believe he’s just
spying around here to see what we’re up to.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” admitted Bob. “I must keep
quiet. But I’m glad it wasn’t Noddy. I guess
he isn’t out of bed yet,” and the boys kept on with
their work, the professor strolling off to see if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
he could get any specimens, while Bill Berry
rowed around a bend of the river, and so out of
sight.</p>

<p>But Bob was mistaken about Noddy not being
out of bed. That bully had gotten up for the
first time that day, and, even while our heroes
were talking of him, he was sitting in the parlor
of his father’s house, trying to evolve in his mind
a plan for learning more about the radium, said
to be located on Snake Island.</p>

<p>“I’ll need some one to help me,” mused
Noddy. “I can take Bill Berry, of course, but
I need some scientific fellow who will know radium
when he sees it, for I don’t, and Bill certainly
couldn’t tell it from a lump of coal. I
wonder what I can do?”</p>

<p>At that moment the door bell rang, and, as the
servant happened to be out, Noddy answered it.
He saw, standing on the steps, a tall, lank man,
whom the word “sleek” seemed to describe better
than any other. The caller wore a long black
coat, a flowing black tie, and had a tall hat, while
he carried a small valise in his hand.</p>

<p>“Ah, good afternoon,” began the stranger,
smiling at Noddy. “I believe I am speaking to
the owner of the house?”</p>

<p>“No, my father owns it,” replied Noddy, not
a little proud of being taken for the head of the
home. “But I can do any business, I guess. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
often help my father. His name is Nixon—I’m
Noddy Nixon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I have heard of you. Your father
is known to me by reputation, and I have called
to see him, as I have in the case of a number of
the most prominent men in town. But I fear I
will have to see Mr. Nixon personally.”</p>

<p>“Won’t I do?” asked Noddy. “I know a lot
about my father’s affairs.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you, and you can judge for
yourself,” went on the man, as he entered the
parlor and sat down. “I am Dr. Kirk Belgrade,
head of the Mortaby Scientific School, a very
important institution of learning. I am traveling
about, seeking to enlarge the scope of our work,
and, naturally I came to Mr. Nixon. I understand
that he was one of the endowers of a number
of colleges, and I thought perhaps he would
give us a contribution. We confer degrees on
those who aid us financially, and there are a number
of scholarships available. Perhaps you yourself
might be interested in taking up a new line
of study.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Noddy. “I go to a
boarding school now, but it isn’t very good. I
might change. Where is your school?”</p>

<p>“Well—er—that is—well, to be frank we
have no fixed place or headquarters,” said Dr.
Belgrade. “The Mortaby Scientific School is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
sort of correspondence institution. Our pupils
are located all over the world, and they get their
lessons by mail, and also recite by mail. There
is a good profit in it, and I’m sure if your father
invested he would get a large return for his
money. Some of the other prominent men in
town have given me encouragement.”</p>

<p>“Did you go to Mr. Slade, or Mr. Baker—or
to Mrs. Hopkins—she’s a rich widow?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“I did call on Mr. Slade and Mr. Baker, but
I regret to say that they—er—they turned me
down,” replied the educator with an oily smile.
“They said they did not believe in my methods.
But I assure you that they are most up to date.
I will call on Mrs. Hopkins, at your suggestion,
however.”</p>

<p>“Better not,” advised Noddy with a grin.
“She and the Slades and Bakers are all alike.
They don’t want anything new. I know ’em.
But maybe my father would invest. He’ll soon
be home, and you can wait if you like.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I will. I’ll show you some of our
literature. I am one of the principal instructors.
In fact I may say that I am the whole school, for
all the other instructors come to me for advice.
Just to show you how up to date we are, I will
mention that we have a small laboratory——”</p>

<p>“Oh, say,” interrupted Noddy eagerly. “Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
you happen to know anything about radium?”</p>

<p>“Radium?” replied the visitor. “Of course
I do—a great deal. Why, to show you how advanced
my college course is, let me say that we
have a small quantity of radium for experimental
purposes.”</p>

<p>“You have!” exclaimed the bully, with increased
eagerness. “The real article?”</p>

<p>“Radium, I do assure you, the genuine article,”
said Dr. Belgrade. “I do not care to
state just how I came into possession of it, but it
is in our laboratory.”</p>

<p>“But I thought you said you had no school
building,” said Noddy, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Well, the laboratory is in my house, next to
the bath room,” explained the instructor. “It
is not a very large laboratory, but I hope to extend
it soon. I need money, and I hope——”</p>

<p>“Radium!” interrupted Noddy. “Radium is
worth money; isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I should say it was, Mr. Nixon.”</p>

<p>“Would you like to know where to get some?”</p>

<p>“Would I? I would give up my present plans,
turn my students over to an assistant, and travel
a long way if I knew where to find some. Why
do you ask?” and the man looked eagerly at
Noddy.</p>

<p>“Do you know radium when you see it?”
asked the bully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indeed I do. I have made a special study of
it, and I can detect it in any form. I am not
boasting when I say that there are few who are
any better informed about radium than I am.
But what do you mean? Is it possible that you
have some radium?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t it,” said Noddy in a low voice,
“but I know where there is some. I’m glad you
happened to call. I’ll tell you all about it, and
maybe we can go together.” Noddy got up and
closed the parlor door, shutting himself in the
room with the sleek educator. Next he quickly
unfolded to him the plot he had formed, after
having overheard what our heroes had said about
Snake Island.</p>

<p>“Is it possible!” gasped Dr. Belgrade, when
Noddy had finished. “Is it possible!”</p>

<p>“It must be, or those fellows wouldn’t plan to
go after it,” replied Noddy. “But I’m going to
get ahead of them, if you’ll help me. Will you?”</p>

<p>“Will I? Well, I guess I will! Now let’s
make some plans. With your father to finance
our expedition, we may all become millionaires!”
and the head of the correspondence college
rubbed his hands together and smiled at Noddy
encouragingly.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>OFF FOR PITTSBURG</small></h2>


<p>“So we start to-morrow,” observed Professor
Snodgrass one evening, when the three chums
were gathered about a table in the library of
Ned’s home. “It seems like a month ago that
we decided to make the trip.”</p>

<p>“And yet it was only about two weeks,” returned
Jerry. “We have had a lot to do in the
meanwhile, though.”</p>

<p>“But everything is in good shape,” remarked
Bob. “We’ve got enough grub aboard to last
until we get to Pittsburg, I think.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course!” laughed Jerry. “You can
trust Bob to look out for the ‘eats’ every time.
I think we’ll make him the permanent commissary
general.”</p>

<p>“Well, I notice you always come around when
the dinner bell rings,” remarked the fat lad significantly.</p>

<p>“He’s got us there,” admitted Ned. “But
it’s a good thing Bob does look after the food, for
we’re always sure to have enough. Now let’s
see where we’re at. Hand me that list, Bob, and
we’ll check things off. If we’re going to start to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
we will have to get any last things we
need to-night.”</p>

<p>The three chums went over the list together,
the professor poring deeply into a scientific book,
making occasional notes, and at times thinking of
the two-tailed toad he hoped to get as a result of
the trip.</p>

<p>“Well, so far Noddy hasn’t bothered us any,”
remarked Ned, when they had completed the
checking of the list, and found that everything
needed was on the boat, or in readiness to stow
away.</p>

<p>“He’s out and around,” remarked Jerry. “I
saw him down the street this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“You did! And did he speak to you?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“Just sort of nodded and thanked me for the
way we fellows pulled him out of the water. He
wasn’t very enthusiastic over it, though, and he
looked rather thin and pale, I thought.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he was hurt worse than we imagined,”
suggested Bob. “Well, if he doesn’t make any
trouble for us, I’ll be satisfied. But I guess it’s
time I went home. I want to get plenty of sleep,
for I’m going to get up early.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” said Jerry. “I guess everything
is in shape. We’ll meet at my house, as
that’s nearest the river, and then we’ll get started
as early as we can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s all settled then; is it?” asked Professor
Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“Everything,” replied Ned. “We’ll go by
motor boat to Pittsburg, get our auto there, and
ride across to Denver, and from there make the
rest of the trip by airship. I guess that’s the best
way to get down into the Grand Canyon.”</p>

<p>“It’s really the only way,” said Mr. Snodgrass.
“Boats are almost out of the question, and
to follow the trails down the sides of the big
chasm wouldn’t help us much, for Snake Island is
far off from any of the places by which you can
get down to the river’s edge. But with an airship
we can descend as well as if we were in an elevator.
Yes, I think you boys have made the best
possible plan.”</p>

<p>Bob and Jerry left Ned’s house soon after this,
and, on the way to their homes they went past the
Nixon residence. Bob, looking up, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Noddy’s sitting up late to-night. There’s a
light in his room.”</p>

<p>“So I see,” replied Jerry. “Well, if he stays
up late he’ll sleep late, and we’ll get off before he
knows it.”</p>

<p>“Why, are you worried about him?” asked
the stout lad.</p>

<p>“Yes, I don’t mind telling you that I am.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, because I’ve seen Bill Berry hanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
around lately. You know how thick he and
Noddy are, and I shouldn’t be a bit surprised
but what Bill was trying to find out where we are
headed for this time.”</p>

<p>“Why would he do that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just so he and Noddy could make trouble
for us. It wouldn’t be the first time they
have camped on our trail.”</p>

<p>“No, that’s right. But I guess we’ll fool ’em
this time.”</p>

<p>But if Bob and Jerry could have looked into
Noddy’s room at that minute, they would have
been made aware that they had plenty of cause
for suspicion.</p>

<p>For, as our two heroes passed on to their
homes, glancing back momentarily at the light in
Noddy’s window, that bully was in close conversation
with a certain sleek individual, who, for
the present, chose to masquerade under the name
of Dr. Kirk Belgrade.</p>

<p>“Do you think you can find out when they go,
and where they are headed for—I mean exactly?”
asked the correspondence school man.</p>

<p>“Sure I can,” declared Noddy. “I’ve had
Bill Berry on the watch for the past week.
They’re going to start in their motor boat to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>“To where?”</p>

<p>“Well, that I don’t know exactly. I’ve tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to find out but I can’t. Bill sort of fell down
on that job. But I’ll get wind of it somehow.
I know where their auto was sent to be
fixed, and the man there knows my father. He’ll
tell me where they are headed for, I’m sure.
But even if we don’t find out, we can go West on
our own hook, and locate Snake Island. The
rest will be easy, and we’ll get that radium before
they do.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” spoke the educator. “I certainly
need the money, and I have given up everything
for this chance. The Mortaby Scientific
School will have to get along without me for a
time, but when I come back, with a fortune, I
will build a real college.”</p>

<p>“First we’ve got to get the radium, and beat
the motor boys!” exclaimed Noddy, as he
grinned in anticipation of the trick he expected
to play.</p>

<p>“You don’t like them, then?”</p>

<p>“I hate ’em all!” snarled the bully, “even if
they did pull me from the river. If they hadn’t,
someone else would.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope we can soon start West,” went
on the sleek individual. “When will your father
give me some money?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow or the next day,” replied Noddy.
“He is willing that I should undertake the trip.
I told him I needed it for my health.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the two talked over the details of their
plot, sitting up until late in the night, while our
heroes peacefully slumbered, and dreamed of
strange adventures on Snake Island in the Grand
Canyon of the Colorado.</p>

<p>Bright and early the next morning Bob and
Ned, with the professor, assembled at Jerry’s
house. The last preparations had been made,
good-byes had been said, and the motor boat
looked over for the last time. She was pulling
uneasily at the mooring lines, which held her fast
to the dock, for there had been a heavy rain, and
the river was much swollen. It was as if the
boat was anxious for the boys to come aboard.</p>

<p>“All ready?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“All ready,” replied Ned, and then, waving
good-byes to Mrs. Hopkins, they started for the
pier. It did not take them long to put their
handbags aboard, and, once the professor was
comfortably settled aft, in the open cockpit, he
began scanning the water for rare insects.</p>

<p>“All aboard!” cried Jerry, as he took his
place at the wheel.</p>

<p>“All aboard,” answered Ned.</p>

<p>“Then let her go,” ordered the steersman, and
Ned turned over the fly wheel to start the motor.</p>

<p>There was a cheer from the little crowd that
had gathered on the dock to see our heroes start.
Andy Rush was among them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” cried the excitable little
chap. “Off you go—wish I was along—never
say die—blow up the boiler—whoop—off for
Pittsburg!”</p>

<p>“Say, I wonder if he ever will calm down?”
remarked Bob, helplessly.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” commented Ned.</p>

<p>“I wish he hadn’t said that last,” said Jerry
in a serious tone.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Ned, as the <i>Dartaway</i>
swung out from the dock.</p>

<p>“Because I’d just as leave everyone wouldn’t
know where we are going. It might get to the
ears of——”</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Bob in a low, tense voice.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“There’s Bill Berry, and Noddy Nixon is with
him,” went on the stout lad, pointing across the
water, to where, a short distance away, there
floated a rowboat, containing the two enemies of
the motor boys.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>IN DANGER</small></h2>


<p>Jerry, Ned and Bob were gazing straight into
the faces of Bill Berry and Noddy Nixon. The
two cronies, in turn, returned the stare, and to
our friends it seemed as if there was an insolent
look on Noddy’s face—a sort of half smile of
triumph, as if he had divined their plans, and was
going to try to frustrate them.</p>

<p>“Mind your wheel!” suddenly called Ned
sharply to the tall steersman. “There’s a rock
just ahead of you, Jerry!”</p>

<p>“That’s so, I forgot about that,” and Jerry
twisted the rudder about so that the <i>Dartaway</i>
swung toward the middle of the stream, missing
the rock by a narrow margin.</p>

<p>“Too close for comfort,” murmured Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Jerry. “I don’t know
why I should have stared so at Noddy.”</p>

<p>“It looks as if he and Bill came out on purpose
to see us off,” commented Ned, as the motor
boat rapidly opened up a gap between herself and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the rowing craft. “I wonder if he heard what
Andy said about Pittsburg?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so,” said the tall lad. “Sounds
carry very clearly over the water, you know, and
Andy has rather a loud voice. Well, it can’t be
helped, and I suppose the only thing for us to
do is to be on our guard.”</p>

<p>“That’s all,” agreed Ned, and by this time
they had gone around a bend, losing sight of the
rowboat, and the dock from which they had
started. The last glimpse they had of Andy
Rush was when that excitable chap was dancing
up and down, waving his hands to them, and
doubtless letting off all sorts of explosive expressions.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass, during this episode, had
taken no part in the conversation, remaining
quietly in his place, scanning the water for a
glimpse of some rare aquatic insect. At times
he would dip into the river a small net he carried,
and, bringing it up filled with mosquito
wrigglers, or other forms of life, he would
gravely examine his catch through a magnifying
glass.</p>

<p>“Ah, here is a rare one!” he would occasionally
cry. “A triple-jointed worm. But I don’t
understand how it got into the water, as it is a
form of land life. This is very puzzling. I
must make notes on this. Perhaps the worm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
having lived on land all its life, is going to become
aquatic in his habits, as the whale did centuries
ago. It is very strange.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see the worm, Professor?” requested
Ned, when he had adjusted the motor to work
smoothly, and while Jerry was steering in and out
to avoid floating logs.</p>

<p>“There it is,” said the scientist, lifting the
specimen out of one of the glass-topped boxes.
“A beautiful creature! Most perfect! And
yet I cannot account for it being in the water.
I shall devote a good deal of space in my new
book to this find. Perhaps I am the first to discover
it, and, if so, I shall be made an honorary
member of the Society for Advanced Scientific
Research. A most beautiful and perfect specimen!”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s an angle worm—a fish worm!”
cried Bob, as he caught sight of the wriggling
creature. “A common, ordinary angle worm!”</p>

<p>“Of course it is,” agreed the professor. “I
know that. It is, as you say, an angle worm—<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">angulus
vermis</i> it might be called or even <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vermis
lophius piscatorius</i>. The first Latin words being
merely indicative of angle and worm, while the
latter, which I prefer, indicates the curious fish
known as the angler, and which is said to catch
other fish by angling for them with some attachment
to its head, which resembles a baited hook.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Of course it’s an angle worm, Bob, but the funny
part of it is how did it get in the water?”</p>

<p>“Easily enough,” spoke Ned. “The river is
much higher than usual, and I suppose it has overflowed
some bank, and washed the poor worms
out. I’m afraid, Professor, that you can’t claim
to be the discoverer of a new kind of worm.”</p>

<p>“Oh pshaw! I guess you’re right!” exclaimed
Uriah Snodgrass in disappointed tones.
“That accounts for it. Well, I don’t want the
specimen then,” and he tossed it back into the
water. There was a little swirl, amid the muddy
waves, and something grabbed the floating worm.</p>

<p>“Fish!” cried Bob. “There are lots of fish
around here, fellows. I’m going to catch some
for dinner.”</p>

<p>“There he goes again!” cried Ned with a
laugh. “We’ve just had breakfast, and yet he’s
thinking of the next meal. Oh, Bob! You’re
hopeless.”</p>

<p>“All right, you don’t have to eat the fish,” retorted
the stout lad, as he got out his line and
some bait he had thought to bring along. “I’ll
catch ’em, and Jerry and I and the professor will
eat ’em. You can live on canned sardines.”</p>

<p>“You won’t catch any with the water as high
and as muddy as it is to-day,” predicted Ned.</p>

<p>“Just you watch,” was all Bob replied.</p>

<p>He cast in, as Jerry steered the boat, the tall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
lad having to give his whole attention to it, for
the stream was filled with floating débris that had
been carried down by the rising water, and it
required skill to avoid collisions. But Jerry
knew his business, and rarely did a log scrape the
<i>Dartaway</i> ever so gently.</p>

<p>Bob went out on the little after-deck to fish,
while the professor also took his place there to
look for more valuable specimens than angle
worms. Ned busied himself about the engine,
and got out some packages of food, and the
dishes that would be needed for the mid-day
meal.</p>

<p>Bob did have pretty good luck fishing, and,
when noon came, he had a number of good-sized
specimens. In order that Jerry could enjoy his
meal without having to eat with one hand and
steer with the other, the boat was tied up in a
little cove and there Bob proceeded to get dinner
on the gasolene stove that was in a small
galley off the main cabin.</p>

<p>“Um! But this is good!” murmured the
stout lad with his mouth fairly well filled.</p>

<p>“It’s a bad habit for cooks to praise their
own broth,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t it good?” demanded Bob.</p>

<p>“Of course it is,” put in Jerry. “It’s a good
meal, Chunky, and Ned is only jealous. Don’t
mind him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t intend to,” declared the stout lad,
helping himself to more fish.</p>

<p>They started off again after dinner, and making
good speed, aided by the current of the river,
they found themselves that night on a small lake
into which the stream emptied. They tied up
near shore, and, the collapsible bunks being let
down, they retired, after sitting up for a while,
talking over the events of the day.</p>

<p>“This sure is sport,” declared Ned, as he
pulled the blankets over him, for, while the day
was warm it was cool at night on the water.</p>

<p>“It’s the right way to spend a vacation,”
agreed Bob.</p>

<p>“And when we get in the auto, and the airship,
we’ll have more fun yet,” predicted Jerry.
“I’m anxious to get to Snake Island.”</p>

<p>“I hope that place doesn’t get its name from
the fact that it’s filled with snakes,” commented
Ned, in sleepy tones. “I hate the things.”</p>

<p>“I hope there are a lot of the reptiles,” spoke
the professor. “I may be able to get a few specimens.
And I certainly do want to get that two-tailed
toad.”</p>

<p>“And I want some radium,” added Jerry.</p>

<p>The next day’s trip was without incident, and
by night they had crossed the lake to its outlet,
down which they expected to proceed for about
a hundred miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>The first part of this trip was delightful, but
on the third day it rained hard, and they had to
stay cooped up in the cabin, which was not much
fun. But the storm could not last forever, and
the sun finally came out, to the satisfaction of
all.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll soon have to take a little land
journey,” remarked Ned, at the close of the fifth
day of their trip.</p>

<p>“How’s that?” asked the professor. “Are
you going to desert the boat?”</p>

<p>“No,” spoke Bob, “but by to-morrow noon
we’ll come to the end of water travel, for a short
space. That is, we’ll need to have the boat
hauled over land to the canal that connects with
the river by which we will get on the Alleghany.
I wrote to a man who is going to move the boat,
and he promised to be on hand with a big truck,
and some helpers. We’ll run the <i>Dartaway</i> up
on the truck, drive over to the canal, and float
her again. Then it will be smooth sailing to
Pittsburg.”</p>

<p>“And we haven’t seen a sign of Noddy
Nixon,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“I hope we don’t—the whole trip,” spoke
Jerry earnestly.</p>

<p>It was a little before noon when they had gone
as far as was practical up the stream on which
they were then motoring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“The dock where the truck is to meet us must
be around here somewhere,” said Ned, who was
steering.</p>

<p>“There’s a man just ahead, who seems to be
waving to us,” put in Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s the place!” cried the merchant’s son.
“Now we’re all right.”</p>

<p>It was no easy work to get the <i>Dartaway</i> out
of the water, and upon the truck, but finally it
was accomplished by means of tackle and windlass.</p>

<p>“Are you boys going to walk, or ride on the
truck to the canal?” asked the teamster, as he
gathered up the reins of the four powerful
horses.</p>

<p>“Guess we might as well ride,” decided Ned.
“We’ll be there as soon as you are then.”</p>

<p>Accordingly the boys climbed up on the truck,
and seated themselves in the cabin of their boat.
The professor accompanied them, and the men
who were to help unload the boat dispersed themselves
about the big vehicle.</p>

<p>It was about a two hours’ ride to the canal,
with so heavy a load, as part of the distance was
up hill. When about half of the journey had
been accomplished one of the men discovered that
the boat was slipping down toward the end of
the truck, and a halt had to be called to shift it
forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“We don’t want it sliding off, and trying to
navigate in the dust!” exclaimed the truckman
with a laugh.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass grew restless at the delay
and finally climbed down off the vehicle, with an
insect net.</p>

<p>“I’m going to walk on ahead,” he remarked.
“I may be able to catch a few rare bugs. I
think I can find the way to the canal all right, in
case you don’t overtake me.”</p>

<p>“It’s a straight road,” called Ned, who had
provided himself with maps of their journey.</p>

<p>The professor walked on, swinging his net
from side to side in an endeavor to catch a butterfly
or bug.</p>

<p>“Has he been that way long?” asked one of
the men of Jerry, as there came a pause in the
work of shifting the boat.</p>

<p>“What way?”</p>

<p>“Cracked, you know. Crazy—bug-house?
Does he get violent?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” laughed the tall lad. “He’s not
crazy,” and then he explained what a scientist
Mr. Snodgrass was.</p>

<p>“Um,” said the man apparently unconvinced.
“It does take queer forms, sometimes. I had
a cousin who always wanted to sleep with his
shoes on. No accounting for their notions.
Come on, now, all together! Heave!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry gave up the attempt to make the man
understand, and, a little later, the boat was shifted
back to its place, and the journey resumed.</p>

<p>They were almost at the end of it, and were
going down a slight hill, when suddenly a dog,
running out from a farmhouse, dashed at the off
forward horse, and nipped its leg. The frightened
animal reared, crowded its mate, and, a
moment later, dashed ahead, breaking one of the
reins. The next instant the team of four powerful
steeds was in a wild gallop down the hill, the
truck swaying from side to side in the road, and
the motor boat creaking and groaning as it
strained at the ropes that held it fast.</p>

<p>“Stop the horses!” yelled one of the men.</p>

<p>“We’ll have a smash-up in another minute if
you don’t!” added Bob.</p>

<p>“The boat is slipping back again!” cried Ned.
“Jerry—Bob—help hold her on! If she slips
off into the road she’ll be smashed!”</p>

<p>The lads braced themselves against their craft
to prevent it sliding off. Some of the men helped
them, but, in spite of this, the terrific speed of the
truck threatened to bring about the danger they
were trying to avoid.</p>

<p>“Stop those horses, Bill!” yelled one of the
men.</p>

<p>“I can’t!” cried the truckman. “One line is
busted, and if I pull on the other I’ll run them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
into the ditch, and then we <em>will</em> be in a mess.
I’ve got to let ’em run it out.”</p>

<p>“They’ll run us into the canal if they keep on
much longer!” cried someone.</p>

<p>“Brace, everybody!” gasped Ned, as he felt
the boat slipping nearer and nearer to the end of
the truck.</p>

<p>“Put on the brakes!” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“Got ’em on, but that’s all the good it does,”
responded the truckman. “I’m afraid we’re
goners, boys! Get ready to jump when you see
the water. Whoa, there! Whoa!” he called
in vain to the horses, who were still madly galloping
down the hill.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s all up with the <i>Dartaway</i>,” murmured
Jerry, as he pressed his shoulder against
the craft.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>DOWN THE ALLEGHANY</small></h2>


<p>The truckman was bracing himself in his seat,
with his foot on the brake, trying his best to
check the speed of the big wagon. As for the
horses, he could do nothing with them, since, as
he said, to pull on the unbroken rein would only
be to send the steeds floundering into the ditch
that bordered the road on either side. That is,
providing the animals answered the pull.</p>

<p>“Can you hold the boat?” cried the truck-owner,
giving a glance over his shoulder at the
men and boys.</p>

<p>“We’re—trying!” gasped Bob, whose face
was red from the effort he was making. Ned
and Jerry, too, as well as the men, were doing
their best.</p>

<p>“There’s the canal, just ahead!” observed one
man.</p>

<p>Jerry had a glimpse of water sparkling in the
rays of the sun. The road was now almost level,
but the horses had not slackened their speed.
Just where the canal came to an end, the highway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
curved abruptly, and it was not hard to
guess what would happen if the runaways were
not checked.</p>

<p>Either they would swing around the curve with
force enough to overturn the truck, or, in their
fright, they would plunge, boat, wagon and all,
into the water. There was not much choice between
the two dangers.</p>

<p>“Get ready to jump!” yelled the truckman on
his seat.</p>

<p>The boys were in despair. They saw their
plans for a fine summer outing partly spoiled, and
their fine boat about to be wrecked.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from the bushes that lined the road,
there ran out to the middle of the highway, and
a little distance ahead of the galloping horses, a
small man. At the sight of him Jerry cried:</p>

<p>“Look! It’s the professor!”</p>

<p>“He’d better get out of the way,” said the
truckman grimly, in a low voice. “Nothing can
stop these animals now, until they wreck everything.
Look out!” he yelled to Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>But the little, bald-headed professor did not
have any such intention. That was evident.
There seemed to be something in the road that
he wanted. His net came down with a swoop,
and he knelt in the dust.</p>

<p>“Look out!” came in a chorus from the men
on the wagon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, for the first time, Professor Snodgrass
seemed to be aware of the approaching vehicle,
with the boat for a load.</p>

<p>Up he jumped to his feet, holding his long-handled
butterfly net, and staring at the approaching
runaways through his big glasses.</p>

<p>“Get out of the way!” yelled the truckman.</p>

<p>The professor ran forward, waving his arms.
In one hand he held his broad-brimmed hat, while
the other flourished the big, green net.</p>

<p>“Stop!” he cried, loud enough to be heard
above the thunder of the wagon wheels. “Stop!
Stop! Don’t come on any farther. You’ll
smash it!”</p>

<p>“Huh! We know that!” yelled the truckman.
“But you can’t make these horses stop
by just inviting ’em to. Look out, or you’ll get
hurt!”</p>

<p>But the professor came on, running straight
at the runaways. Now he was almost under
their feet, but with a wild yell he still advanced.</p>

<p>Suddenly he threw his hat in the face of one
of the leading horses, and, with another quick
motion, he crashed his long-handled net across
the eyes of the other. Then, nimbly leaping to
one side, the professor caught the broken, dangling
rein, and braced back with all his might.
Though a small man, he was powerful, and his
weight told.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” cried the truckman. In an
instant he began pulling on the unbroken rein
which he still held, and thus, with the professor
on one side, being dragged along, and the driver
sawing on the other line, the horses were pulled
up evenly, a thing that had been impossible before.</p>

<p>“By Jove! I believe they’re going to stop!”
cried Jerry, as he noticed a slackening in the speed
of the horses.</p>

<p>“It’s about time, too!” added the truckman,
as he looked at the waters of the canal, not far
distant. He continued to pull on one line. The
professor still clung to the other, and the brakes
were jammed on. Add to this that the road
was level, and that the truck was heavily loaded,
and it can easily be seen that the horses, tired as
they were from their run, did not need much
more to stop them. They came down to a trot,
then to a walk, and finally stopped. The truckman
leaped from his seat, after a glance to make
sure that the boat was in no immediate danger of
slipping off, though it had slid back quite a way.</p>

<p>“Say, that was a plucky stop!” the man cried,
holding out his hand to the professor. “I’ve
caught some runaways in my time, but never better
than that. You saved us from a bad smash-up.”</p>

<p>“Um! Well, perhaps I did,” admitted Uriah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Snodgrass slowly, “but I must confess I wasn’t
thinking of that at the time. I wanted you to
stop before you got too far, that was all.”</p>

<p>“And didn’t you want to save us?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course. But you see I was just
capturing a new and very rare specimen of a
yellow grasshopper when you came along. I almost
had him in my net, but he jumped under a
stone, and I was afraid if the horses came along
they might step on the stone, and crush the insect
or run a wheel over him. That’s why I wanted
to stop you. I’m glad I did, though I’ll have to
put a new handle on my net, for it’s broken.
But I must see if I have the grasshopper.”</p>

<p>He ran to a flat stone in the road, carefully
raised it, and made a grab for something underneath.</p>

<p>“I’ve got him! I’ve got him!” he cried.
“Oh, you little beauty! You’re worth at least
fifteen dollars. Oh, I’m glad I stopped the runaways!”</p>

<p>“Well, you are a queer one,” murmured the
truckman as he proceeded to tie the broken rein,
and then he and his men made the slipping boat
secure, to hold until they could cover the short
remaining distance to the canal. “Stopping a
runaway to save a grasshopper! That’s the
limit!”</p>

<p>“But it’s a yellow grasshopper, and very rare,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
put in the professor with a smile, as he placed
the insect in one of the cases he always carried.
“I doubt if any college but mine will have a
specimen like this. How did the runaway happen?”</p>

<p>The others told him about the dog that had
scared the horses, and then the boys, having expressed
their appreciation of what the professor
had done, helped the men steady the boat for the
rest of the trip.</p>

<p>The horses were quiet enough now, and soon
had the truck at the edge of the canal. There the
work of getting the <i>Dartaway</i> into the water again
was speedily accomplished, and, having paid the
men, and called the professor away from an ant
hill he was examining through a magnifying glass,
the motor boys once more got underway.</p>

<p>“Talk about excitement, it’s with us almost
from the start,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, I thought our boat was a goner there,
one spell,” added Jerry. “It took all my nerve
to hold on.”</p>

<p>“Mine too,” added Bob. “I think I’ll have
to make a cup of coffee, and take some sandwiches
to quiet down.”</p>

<p>And this time neither Ned nor Jerry laughed
at their fat chum.</p>

<p>Their trip along the quiet canal was uneventful,
and in a few days, after tying up nights along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
shore of the river into which the canal opened,
they swept out on the waters of the Alleghany,
and were headed for Pittsburg.</p>

<p>“I hope our auto is all ready for us, and that
we don’t have to wait,” remarked Ned one evening,
as they got ready to retire for the night.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll know by this time to-morrow,”
spoke Jerry. “We ought to be in Pittsburg
then.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with the boat?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I’ve arranged to store it until we get back,”
replied the tall lad. “We’ll have to spend at
least a day here, trying out the auto, and laying in
some supplies. In that time we can see that the
boat is properly put away.”</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass sat up rather late that
night arranging and classifying some specimens
he had caught, and it was nearly midnight when
he turned in. The boys were sound asleep, and
the little scientist was soon in the same blissful
state.</p>

<p>What time he was awakened Jerry did not
know, but he sat up suddenly in bed, for he heard
someone moving stealthily about on the after-deck.
Then the door of the cabin was cautiously
tried:</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” cried the tall lad suddenly.</p>

<p>There was no answer, and reaching out his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
hand Jerry sought for the switch that would
turn on the electric lights which were operated
by a storage battery. As he felt the button, he
heard a boat scraping against the side of the
<i>Dartaway</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>OFF IN THE AUTO</small></h2>


<p>“What’s the matter?” cried Ned, as he heard
Jerry’s voice.</p>

<p>“Anything wrong?” demanded Bob sleepily.
“Has anything happened, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” was the tall lad’s answer. “I fancy
I was too quick for them. But I thought I heard
someone on board, and I’m certain that a boat
scraped against our side. I’m going to have a
look.”</p>

<p>“Better be careful,” advised Ned, as he pulled
on some garments. “They may be river
thieves.”</p>

<p>“Thieves! Thieves!” cried Uriah Snodgrass,
sitting up suddenly. “Are they after my
specimens! Don’t let them get anything, boys!
Those specimens are more valuable than gold!
Oh, where are my glasses? I can’t see a thing.”</p>

<p>“Switch off all the lights!” whispered Ned to
Jerry. “They can see us in here, and we can’t
get a glimpse of them. Turn ’em off!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry did so, and at once there came another
sound as if someone was out on the small after-deck.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” challenged Ned.</p>

<p>There was no answer. Once more came the
noise of a boat rubbing against the side of the
<i>Dartaway</i>, and a cautious voice could be heard
whispering:</p>

<p>“Come on! Can’t do anything now!”</p>

<p>“Who are you? What do you want?” demanded
Jerry, but he received no answer.</p>

<p>With a quick spring Ned was at the cabin door
that opened out into a sort of cockpit, and thence,
by a short companionway to the deck. Throwing
the portal open, Ned flashed on a small searchlight.
As he played it about the river he picked
up a small boat, containing two persons, who were
rowing quickly away.</p>

<p>“What did you want? Were you on our
boat?” demanded Ned, and then, as the two in
the small craft maintained a silence, Ned flashed
the light full in their faces. As he did so he gave
a cry that brought Jerry and Bob out to him.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” cried the tall lad.
“Are you hurt, Ned? Did they attack you?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m all right. But look at that boat!
See who’s in it!”</p>

<p>Jerry and Bob gazed across the stretch of
black and swirling water, illuminated by the shaft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of light from the search lantern. It threw into
bold relief the boat and the occupants.</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon!” gasped Jerry, as he saw the
face of the bully.</p>

<p>“But who’s with him?” asked Bob. “I’ve
never seen him before, that I know of.”</p>

<p>“He’s a stranger, I guess,” said Ned. “Noddy
must have hired him to help get ahead
of us.”</p>

<p>“But what were they doing here?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Trying to sneak up while we were asleep, to
see what they could get, I suppose,” remarked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“My specimens!” exclaimed Professor Snodgrass,
who had come out to join the boys.
“That’s what they were after. That yellow
grasshopper is what they wanted!”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so,” said Jerry in a low voice,
as he watched the two rowing rapidly away—Noddy
and a tall man, the latter with a sleek
appearance, as though he was always trying to
figure out the easiest way of getting something
for nothing.</p>

<p>“Hello you, Noddy!” suddenly called Ned.
“What did you want here?”</p>

<p>The bully and his companion kept silent.</p>

<p>“If you come around again I’ll turn the hose
on you,” threatened Bob.</p>

<p>There was no reply, and a moment later the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
rowboat went around the end of a projecting
dock, and was out of range of the light.</p>

<p>“Well, if they weren’t after my specimens
what did they want?” inquired the professor.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I think,” went on Jerry as
they returned to the comfortable cabin, for it was
cool in the night air, and they were lightly clad.
“I believe they sneaked on board to see if they
could get any clews as to where we are bound
for.”</p>

<p>“You mean Snake Island?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes. You see Noddy doesn’t know the exact
location, even if, in some way, he has guessed, or
overheard, some of us saying that we were going
to the Grand Canyon. He needs to know more
definitely just where we’re going, so he can sneak
along, and try to get ahead of us.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean he was looking for a map?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, or something like that. Maybe he
thought we would be leaving our traveling directions
lying around loose.”</p>

<p>“Say, maybe it would be a good scheme to
fix up a fake map, and leave it where he could
get it,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“Hardly,” decided Jerry. “He’d get on to
the fact that it was a fake, for he knows we
wouldn’t be as careless as that. I think the best
way is to do just as we have been doing—make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
no map or sketch of where we’re heading for.
In fact we can’t, for we’ve got to prospect around
ourselves to find Snake Island.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ve got to be on our guard against
Noddy,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“All the while I’m afraid, since he’s taken to
trailing after us,” resumed Jerry. “I’d like to
know who that fellow was with him. He looks
like a sleek rascal.”</p>

<p>“Like Bill Berry, only different,” was Ned’s
opinion. “I wonder where Bill is?”</p>

<p>“Oh, probably hanging around somewhere,”
came from Bob. “He and Noddy generally
travel together.”</p>

<p>There was nothing more that could be done
that night, save to see to it that the cabin doors
and windows were securely fastened. Jerry left
the searchlight aglow, as he thought this would
discourage any further attempt to board the
motor boat. And, as a matter of fact, our
friends were not disturbed again that night.</p>

<p>They made an early start for Pittsburg the
next morning, keeping a watch for Noddy, but
they did not see him. By noon they had tied up
at the wharf where their boat was to be hauled
out for storage.</p>

<p>“Now for the auto!” exclaimed Jerry, when
the craft had been safely put away, and such stores
as they needed, together with their clothing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
weapons and other things, had been piled up ready
to be put in the motor car.</p>

<p>They found that the repairs to their machine
were almost completed, and that the car had been
greatly improved. A new body had been put
on, giving more room, so that, if necessary, they
could sleep on board. And a small gasolene
stove had been fitted up, so that a simple meal
could be prepared. You can easily see that this
was Bob’s idea.</p>

<p>“Well, we can start in a couple of days,” announced
Jerry after a visit to the auto shop.</p>

<p>“And we’ll need that time to give her a try-out,”
added Ned.</p>

<p>“And buy what grub we will need!” put in
Chunky.</p>

<p>“Oh, forget the everlasting ‘eats’!” begged
Jerry. “We don’t need to take much. We can
buy it as we go along, and it will be fresher.”</p>

<p>“I meant a few things like sandwiches, pickles
and cake,” went on Bob. “To eat between
meals, you know. I often get hungry before it’s
meal time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we know it! You needn’t tell us,” cried
Ned with a laugh.</p>

<p>They tried their auto the next day, having put
up at a hotel near the repair works. The car
made good speed, and seemed to have more power
than before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“She’s great!” cried Jerry. “Now for a
long trip West!”</p>

<p>Their preparations were complete. Almost at
the last minute, though, the professor nearly
backed out. He found a curious bug in the hotel
where they stayed, and he wanted to remain a
week or more, to hunt for others.</p>

<p>“You’d better come on and look for that
two-tailed toad, Professor,” advised Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I had,” agreed the little scientist.
“But on our way back we’ll stop here, and I
can have another look for more of those rare
bugs.”</p>

<p>The auto, well filled with the goods of our
friends, and themselves, was ready for a start,
and, having inquired the best route on from Pittsburg,
the boys, with Jerry at the wheel, set off
one fine morning. What lay before them they
little realized.</p>

<p>On and on they went, over fairly good roads,
until they came to the open country. Then, having
fixed the spark and gasolene levers to carry
them at a moderate pace, Jerry settled back to
enjoy the scenery.</p>

<p>They had covered perhaps ten miles, and Bob
was wondering whether he dare mention cooking
a light lunch, as they whirled along, when Ned,
who had looked back, uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>For answer Ned took a pair of powerful field
glasses from a pocket inside the car. He focused
them on an auto that was coming rapidly along
behind the car of our friends.</p>

<p>“They’ve been following us for some time,”
spoke Ned, “and I want to see who they are.”
He was silent a moment, and then he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I thought so! Noddy Nixon again, and this
time Bill Berry is with him, as well as that other
man! Fellows, he’s on our trail!”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s where he gets off!” cried Bob,
as he reached his hand in his pocket, and pulled
out a small wooden box. He opened it, and
scattered something out on the road.</p>

<p>“What’s that!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“Big tacks!” answered Bob. “I thought
something like this might happen, so I got ready
for Noddy. Some of those tacks will stick point
upward, and maybe something will happen.
They’re good and sharp, and rather bad for pneumatic
tires,” he added with a laugh.</p>

<p>He tossed the empty box away, and he and Ned
looked at the car coming on behind them.</p>

<p>“Think they’ll hit ’em?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” replied the stout lad.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a commotion, and the pursuing
auto was seen to swerve to one side.</p>

<p>“There they go!” cried Bob. “Two tires
to the bad, I think! I guess they won’t follow us
right away. Speed her up, Jerry!”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>HELD UP</small></h2>


<p>“That’s the way to do it, Bob!” exclaimed
Ned.</p>

<p>“I never imagined you were such a plotter,”
complimented Jerry. “How’d you come to think
of it, Chunky?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it just sort of came to me,” explained the
stout lad, as he looked back to see Noddy and
his companions leap from their auto, and examine
the burst tires. “I figured that after the
way Noddy’d been spying on us that he’d try to
follow us, so I got ready for him. I thought it
out that tire trouble was the easiest for me to
bring about, and it would hold him back as well
as if it was something else. So I bought the
tacks.”</p>

<p>“And made good use of ’em!” chuckled Jerry.
“You’re all right, Bob!”</p>

<p>Noddy Nixon straightened up from an examination
of his stalled auto. He shook his fist at our
friends who were rapidly drawing away.</p>

<p>“I’ll—fix—you—for—this!” yelled the bully
in a loud voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, you’ll have plenty of time to do it in,”
remarked Bob with a laugh. “You’ll have to use
new shoes, and inner tubes too, I’m thinking.
Speed her up, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“All right,” and the tall lad turned on more
gasolene, until the big car was going along at a
rapid pace.</p>

<p>“Not too fast,” cautioned Ned. “We don’t
want to be taken in for speeding, you know.”</p>

<p>“Not much danger,” returned Jerry. “It’s
rather a lonely stretch of country for several miles
yet.”</p>

<p>“How do you think he managed to get after
us so quickly?” asked Professor Snodgrass, who,
wonderful to relate, was neither looking at his
specimens, making notes about, nor seeking to capture
others. He had been too much interested in
the chase and its sudden termination.</p>

<p>“Oh, he must have heard Andy Rush say we
were going to Pittsburg,” spoke Jerry, “and he
merely came on here ahead of us, by train, while
we traveled by boat. Then he simply got his
auto ready, and lay in wait for us. But you put
a spoke in his wheel, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Two or three,” chuckled Ned.</p>

<p>As they sped on they talked of Noddy, and
speculated on what his plan might be in regard
to following them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s all guess work,” declared Jerry. “No
matter what we do he may turn up on our trail
sooner or later. The only thing to do is to fight
him when we see him, be on our guard all the
while, and not to worry.”</p>

<p>“I agree with Jerry,” said Uriah Snodgrass.
“Now, as long as we’re so far ahead, Jerry, can’t
you go a little slower?”</p>

<p>“Why, does the speed make you dizzy?”
asked the steersman, for indeed the pace was very
rapid.</p>

<p>“No, but I’d like a chance to look for insects
on the bushes as we pass. You never can tell
when you may come across a rare specimen,” and
through his big glasses the professor anxiously
scanned the bushes on either side of the highway,
for Jerry obligingly slackened the speed of the
big car.</p>

<p>“Are we going to sleep in the car or a hotel to-night?”
asked Ned, as the afternoon drew to a
close, finding them about a hundred miles away
from Pittsburg.</p>

<p>“I vote for the car,” spoke Jerry. “We
haven’t tried it in some time. Besides, we can do
as we please, and won’t have to bother with fixing
up, as we would at a hotel.</p>

<p>“Another thing. If we go to a hotel, Noddy
may find it out, and he can thus keep closer tabs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
on our movements. Whereas, if we sleep in the
car, on some country road, we can start off before
daylight, breakfast when we please, and no one
will be any the wiser.”</p>

<p>“All right, the car it is,” agreed Ned. Anything
suited the professor.</p>

<p>“Another good point about the car,” said Bob,
“is that we can——”</p>

<p>“Eat whenever we want to,” finished Jerry
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t going to say so,” retorted Bob. “I
was going to say we could sleep better here, for it
will be quieter out under the trees than in a
hotel.”</p>

<p>“That’s the time he had you, Jerry,” laughed
Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, pick out a good place as you go along,”
advised the tall lad, “and we’ll pull up there and
stop.”</p>

<p>“That hill looks to be in a good location,”
suggested Bob, pointing to a rise in the distance.
“There is a grove of trees there, and we can pull
into them for the night. Speed up, and make it,
Jerry.”</p>

<p>The lad at the wheel was about to pull over the
gasolene lever, and adjust the spark, when, out
from a little country lane, just in front of the auto,
leaped a man, with a shining badge on his coat, a
club in one hand and a revolver in the other. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
held out his arms to obstruct their passage, at the
same time crying in loud tones:</p>

<p>“Halt! Hold on there! You can’t go any
further! I’m the law, an’ I says so. You’ve got
to come with me!”</p>

<p>Jerry looked quickly at the speedometer, and
saw that it registered only about six miles per
hour. He was glad he had not sent the car racing
ahead.</p>

<p>“Come on now! No tricks! Stop that car!”
commanded the evident official. “You’ve got to
come with me.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Jerry. “Not for speeding
evidently, for we were going like a snail.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say nothin’ about no speedin’,” replied
the man. “It’s a more serious charge than
that. I’ve been on the lookout for ye a long time,
an’ I got ye, by heck! Come along!”</p>

<p>By this time Jerry had easily brought the car
to a stop not far from the grizzled man.</p>

<p>“What right have you got to stop us?” demanded
the young steersman. “Who are you,
and what is the charge against us?”</p>

<p>“I’m Constable Enberry Snook,” was the answer,
“and this here is my authority,” and he
tapped his badge with the club. “I derive my
authority from th’ selectmen of Huckleberry
Township, an’ these likewise is th’ main instruments
that I use,” and he glanced from his club<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
to his revolver, and back at the party in the auto.
“Now be ye goin’ t’ come along peaceable like,
or have I got t’ use force?”</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand,” said Jerry, while a
puzzled look came over the faces of the others.
“We haven’t been speeding, and we haven’t assaulted
any one that I know of.”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” declared Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve been instructed t’ arrest ye,” went
on Constable Snook, “an’ I’m goin’ t’ do my duty,
by heck! Now will ye come along peaceable, or
have I got t’——”</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence, for with a cry
that was startling in its suddenness Professor
Snodgrass, who had been sitting in front with
Jerry, fairly leaped from his seat, and dashed at
the constable.</p>

<p>“Don’t move! Don’t stir!” cried the excited
scientist. “I’ve got it! It’s on you! Don’t
move! I’ve been looking for it ever and ever so
long!”</p>

<p>A moment later he had hold of the constable’s
coat.</p>

<p>“Here! Let me go! Onhand me! This is
treason! Ye’re assaultin’ an officer in th’ performance
of his office, an’ it’s ten years’ imprisonment
fer that offense. Let me go, I tell ye! Don’t
ye dare t’ strike me! I’ve got assistants with me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Help! Help! He’s chokin’ me! He’s chokin’
an officer of th’ law!”</p>

<p>Mr. Snook, dropping both his club and revolver,
sought in vain to pull away from the grasp
of Professor Snodgrass, and then the constable,
finding that the scientist had too firm a hold,
pulled out a whistle, and blew a shrill blast. A
moment later two men, evidently farmhands,
each armed with a pitchfork, leaped out of the
bushes at the side of the road.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>NODDY IN ADVANCE</small></h2>


<p>There was a moment’s pause, during which all
the actors in the little rural comedy looked at
each other. And, as for the professor and the
constable, they did more than look, for the scientist
still had a firm hold of the other’s coat, and
the man was pulling desperately to get away.</p>

<p>“Are ye there, Sim an’ Jake?” gasped the
constable.</p>

<p>“Thet’s what we be!” cried the taller of the
farmers, evidently Sim, as he advanced with
ready pitchfork.</p>

<p>“Me too,” put in Jake. “What’s up, Enberry?
Have them highwaymen attacked ye?”</p>

<p>“Attacked me? I should say they had!” cried
the constable. “That’s why I whistled for help.
Jab ’em!”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried Jerry, fearing the professor
might get hurt. “Come on, boys,” he urged Ned
and Bob. “We’ve got to take a hand in
this!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“But what in the world does it all mean?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“And what makes the professor act so queer?”
Bob wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Don’t stop to ask questions!” cried Jerry,
vaulting from his seat. “Come on!”</p>

<p>The three boys advanced toward the group of
men who now surrounded Uriah Snodgrass. The
scientist still retained his grip of the constable
with one hand, while with the other he was making
cautious advances toward the coat collar of
the farmer-officer.</p>

<p>“Let me be!” cried the constable. “Jab him,
Sim an’ Jake! Jab him!”</p>

<p>“Keep still,” ordered Professor Snodgrass.
“I’ll have him in another minute!”</p>

<p>“Ye’ve got me now, consarn ye!” snapped the
constable, trying in vain to pull away. “If ye lay
another hand on me I’ll have ye sent t’ jail fer
life! Let me go, I tell ye!”</p>

<p>“Look out with those pitchforks!” cried Jerry,
as he saw Sim advance the prongs dangerously
close to the professor’s legs.</p>

<p>“There! I’ve got it!” suddenly exclaimed the
little scientist. His hand made a descent on the
farmer’s collar, and then, with something tightly
clasped in his fist, Mr. Snodgrass leaped back.
Sim and Jake closed up alongside of the man who
had summoned them by whistle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’d you take offen me?” demanded Mr.
Snook suspiciously. “My badge? Ef ye
have——”</p>

<p>“I only took one of the most beautiful specimens
of a green spider I have ever seen,” was the
answer of the professor. “I saw it on your coat
collar, and I was so afraid it would get away. I
had to act quickly. The only way was to grab
you, for if you had felt the spider on your neck,
it might have tickled you, and you would have
brushed it off. Then it would have been lost for
ever. Ah, but I have you, my little beauty!” and
the professor peered in between a crack in his
fingers to make sure that the spider had not escaped.
A moment later he had popped it into one
of his specimen boxes.</p>

<p>“A—a spider?” gasped Mr. Snook, as if he
had not understood.</p>

<p>“A <em>green</em> spider,” corrected Mr. Snodgrass.
“A most perfect specimen. It was on your coat
collar. A moment later it would have crawled on
your neck.”</p>

<p>“An’ if it had, I’d have squashed it, sure!”
cried Mr. Snook. “I sure would have squashed
it! A green spider! Why I’d a squashed it, if
it had been a red, white an’ blue one! I hate ’em!
Ye must be crazy t’ want ’em!”</p>

<p>“I want them for scientific purposes,” said
Uriah Snodgrass, and then he briefly explained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
that he traveled for a college that wanted all the
specimens he could collect.</p>

<p>“A college perfesser,” murmured Sim. “Say,
Jake, it’s a good thing we didn’t jab him.”</p>

<p>“I guess it is. An’ t’ think of any mortal man
wantin’ such things as bugs!”</p>

<p>“Well, everybody to their notion,” said Mr.
Snook grimly. “If ye want spiders ye’re welcome
t’ ’em. But that don’t alter th’ fact that
you folks have got t’ come along with me.” He
was less excited now.</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand,” spoke Jerry.
“What is the charge, and who makes it? Were
you waiting here for us?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I was,” declared the constable.
“I got a telephone t’ be on the lookout for ye.
I was warned ye’d be desperit, an’ try t’ escape,
so I swore in Sim an’ Jake as my special deputies.
It looks like I’d need ’em, too. Jake, stand by on
this side of me, an’ Sim, you git on th’ other. If
they starts t’ run, jab ’em. Now, I arrest ye in
th’ name of th’ law,” and in turn he laid his hand
on the shoulders of Jerry, Bob, Ned and the professor.
“Are ye comin’ along peaceable, or shall
I have t’ use force?” he asked again.</p>

<p>“If this is a regular arrest, by a regular officer
we certainly will come along peaceably,” replied
Jerry. “But who makes the charge?”</p>

<p>“That I can’t tell ye. I got my authority from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Judge Amos Blackford. Ye’ll have t’ appear before
him. It were him as were telephoned t’, an’
he passed it on t’ me.”</p>

<p>“And you really have the authority to arrest
us?” asked Ned, still doubting.</p>

<p>“There’s th’ warrant, sworn t’, all reg’lar an’
in due form, according t’ law,” said the constable,
pulling out a paper with a flourish. “Ye kin
look at it.”</p>

<p>Jerry read it quickly. It was merely a short
form of bench warrant, “sworn to on information
and belief,” wherein the judge himself appeared
as the accuser, the real party’s name not
being mentioned.</p>

<p>“If ye don’t believe that, ye kin ask Jake an’
Sim here if I ain’t th’ regular constable fer this
township,” added Mr. Snook proudly.</p>

<p>“That’s what he is!” chorused the two farm
hands.</p>

<p>“Well, then I suppose we will have to go with
you,” admitted Jerry, “though I don’t understand
it. Come along, boys. Do you want to
ride with us?” he asked, turning to the two farm
hands and the constable.</p>

<p>“Not for me,” spoke Sim, and Jake, too,
shook his head. “I wouldn’t ride in one of them
gasolene wagons fer a month’s wages,” added
Sim.</p>

<p>“Then I guess we can find room for you, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Snook,” went on Jerry. “That is if you’re not
afraid of the machine, and don’t imagine that such
desperate characters as we are will do away with
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess I kin trust ye,” said the constable
with a sheepish grin. “Th’ judge’s house is about
a mile down th’ road. He kin hold court there,
an’ fine ye, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t see what for,” said Jerry. “However,
come along.”</p>

<p>They were soon in the auto, and had started
off, the two hired men, with their pitchforks,
standing in the road with open-mouthed wonder
as the car shot away. Ned noticed that Mr.
Snook grasped the sides of the seat with nervous
hands, as if he expected something to happen at
any moment. Chunky was a bit nervous, and
Jerry was clearly puzzled. As for the professor
he was too much occupied in making notes about
the green spider to care whether he was arrested
or not.</p>

<p>It was not a long run to the house of Judge
Blackford, who lived in a comfortable residence.
He himself proved to be a genial, old-fashioned
gentleman.</p>

<p>“Well, Enberry,” he observed with a twinkle
in his eyes as the auto drove up, “you got the
desperadoes, I see.”</p>

<p>“Yep,” answered the constable shortly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did they abuse you much; have much trouble
in capturing them?”</p>

<p>“Nope. They come along peaceable enough,
though at one time——” and then, thinking that
he had not proved himself much of a hero in the
spider episode, the constable stopped.</p>

<p>“Out with it!” cried the judge with a laugh.
“I’ll find it out sooner or later.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell ye later,” promised Mr. Snook nervously.</p>

<p>“May I ask what this is all about?” inquired
Jerry. “The constable says we are charged with
assault and battery. By whom?”</p>

<p>“By Noddy Nixon!” was the unexpected answer
of Judge Blackford.</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon!” cried Jerry. “Is he here?”</p>

<p>“No. I’ll tell you how it was,” went on the
magistrate. “I received a telephone this noon,
from Judge Lawton, of Middleville township.
He said a party of autoists had come to him, and
had sworn that another party of autoists, naming
and describing you, had caused them to burst two
tires. And, as the tires burst, Mr. Nixon and his
party were thrown to one side of their car, painfully
bruising and contusing them, as the warrant
says.</p>

<p>“So Judge Lawton, before whom the original
warrant was sworn out, asked me to issue a supplementary
one, and to intercept you as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
came through here. Which I had to do, it being
my duty. Now you can consider yourself
charged with the crime, and how do you plead.
I’ll hold court right here. Did you or didn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I did it,” answered Bob. “I
threw the tacks in the road. But it was to prevent
Noddy from following us.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the judge was told as much of the
story as Jerry and his chums thought necessary to
explain of their conduct, no mention being made
of the radium on Snake Island. He was told how
Noddy had repeatedly tried to take a mean advantage.</p>

<p>“Hum. That makes it different,” spoke Judge
Blackford. “I reckon that Nixon chap didn’t tell
this to my friend Judge Lawton. Otherwise he
wouldn’t have asked me to issue a warrant. Now
this is how the matter stands.</p>

<p>“I was requested to apprehend and hold you
for examination. That I must do. This Nixon
fellow promised to be here in the morning, at nine
o’clock, to give his evidence. I don’t believe he’ll
come and face you. But I must hold you until
then. I ask you, in the meanwhile to be my guests.
Then, in the morning, if he does not appear, I
shall discharge you, and explain matters to Judge
Lawton. I know he will approve of it. Will you
stay and dine with me? I’ll be glad of your company,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and you needn’t consider yourselves prisoners.
You’re out on bail, so to speak. Supper
will soon be ready. Will you stay?”</p>

<p>“I—yes—of course we will!” cried Bob so
quickly that both his chums laughed, and Mr.
Blackford looked at them curiously.</p>

<p>“Then the court is adjourned,” went on the
magistrate. “Come in, boys, after you leave
your auto in the barn. You needn’t wait, Enberry.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Mr. Snook, who hurried
off, looking over his shoulder as if he feared he
might see more spiders.</p>

<p>The boys found Judge Blackford to be a most
congenial host. It developed that he and Professor
Snodgrass had once attended the same preparatory
school, and the pair exchanged pleasant
memories.</p>

<p>The judge explained how Noddy had probably
proceeded.</p>

<p>“After his tires were repaired,” he said, “the
Nixon fellow must have hurried on, following
you. He figured out that you would have to pass
through here, as this is the main road. Then he
went to Middleville, swore out a warrant, which
he had no right to do under the circumstances,
and the rest you know. I am sorry you were inconvenienced.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right,” said Bob. “We’ll probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
have a better meal than if we ate in the auto;
eh, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Say, Chunky, you are the limit!” cried Jerry,
and then he had to explain to the judge their
chum’s failing.</p>

<p>The magistrate, however, took quite a liking
to Bob, and soon there was a merry party gathered
at the table. The evening was spent pleasantly,
and there were plenty of comfortable beds
in the judge’s big, old-fashioned house, where he
and his wife lived with some old servants.</p>

<p>Nine o’clock came next morning, but Noddy
Nixon did not appear.</p>

<p>“He only did this to delay us,” declared Jerry,
and the others agreed with him.</p>

<p>“Well, if he isn’t here by ten I’ll formally discharge
you, and send the warrant back to Judge
Lawton with an explanation,” said Judge Blackford.</p>

<p>Ten o’clock brought no change in the situation,
and holding court in his library, the magistrate
discharged the “prisoners.” Constable Snook
was on hand, and looked rather disappointed
when he saw that he was not to have the pleasure
of taking the boys and the professor to jail.</p>

<p>“But we have strict laws agin’ speedin’ here,”
he warned them, as Jerry got out the car to resume
the trip. “If I catch ye’ speedin’ I’ll have t’
take ye in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“We won’t come this way soon again,” replied
Jerry. Then, good-byes having been said to the
judge and his wife, our friends started on their
journey.</p>

<p>“I wonder what happened to Noddy?” spoke
Ned, who had taken his place on the front seat
with Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, he has either turned back, or else he’s
waiting until we get far enough ahead of him so
that he can follow as he pleases,” replied the tall
lad.</p>

<p>They had turned off the main road to reach the
home of the judge, and were now coming out of a
sort of long country lane, thickly bordered with
trees, to reach the main highway again. As they
were about to swing around a turn they all heard
the chug-chug of an auto.</p>

<p>“Someone’s coming,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes. I guess we’ll let ’em get ahead of us,
so we won’t have to take so much dust,” decided
Jerry. “We can wait here in the shade.”</p>

<p>He stopped the car, behind a screen of trees
and bushes, not far from the main road. <a href="#image03">A moment
later a car shot past</a>, and, as it did so, Ned
uttered a low exclamation.</p>

</div>

<p>“Did you see that?” he asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I sure did!” replied the tall lad.</p>

<p>“What was it?” inquired Bob, who was in the
rear with the professor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon!” answered Jerry. “He’s
ahead of us now, and that’s where we want him.
He can’t follow us now. I guess, Noddy, you’ve
over-reached yourself,” and Jerry smiled grimly.</p>

<small>DISAPPOINTMENT</small></h2>


<p>“What do you suppose his game is?” asked
Bob, as the auto containing Noddy and two others
shot around a curve in the main road, leaving a
cloud of dust behind.</p>

<p>“His game was to delay us long enough to
catch up to us, I think,” explained Jerry. “You
see he lost time when he had to stop to fix his
tires, and he’s depending on us to show him the
way to Snake Island, since he failed to get any
clews as he sneaked around. But he spoiled his
own chances. We’re behind him now, and he’ll
have his own troubles tracing us.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to let him get a long way in
advance?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I think so. The more trouble we can give
him to pick us up the better—for us. I’m even
going to get off the main road, if I can, and take
a less-used route.”</p>

<p>“The nerve of him charging us with assault
and battery, just because he happened to run over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
a few tacks!” exclaimed Bob, with an air of virtuous
indignation.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose it did batter them up a bit,”
remarked Jerry with a smile. “The auto stopped
rather suddenly, you remember.”</p>

<p>“It sure did,” agreed Ned. “But say, I wonder
who that other chap is with Noddy. I saw
Bill Berry plainly enough, but I can’t imagine who
the other fellow is.”</p>

<p>“I had a glimpse of his face,” said Professor
Snodgrass, looking up from his note book. “I
have seen him before, somewhere, but I can’t
recollect where. I never forget a face, but the
association sometimes escapes me. However, I
may recall it later. I think—hold on, Jerry, don’t
move!” he exclaimed suddenly, for the tall lad
had reached forward to start the car. “There’s
a fine, big yellow-backed toad at the foot of that
stump. I must get it. It isn’t as valuable as the
two-tailed one, but it is a very good specimen,”
and the scientist leaped out and was soon in possession
of the toad, which he clapped into a box.</p>

<p>“All ready now?” asked Jerry, with his hand
on the gear lever.</p>

<p>“All ready—unless I see something else,” answered
Uriah Snodgrass, and the auto rolled
slowly forward. Noddy had been given enough
start so that there was no danger of catching up
to him unless he halted, and he was not likely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
do that, Jerry thought. At the first farmhouse
they stopped to inquire their way on some less
frequented road, and, learning it, they took another
highway, which, while not so good to travel
on, made it less likely that they would meet or
pass the bully.</p>

<p>For three days they traveled on, having fine
weather on all but one—the day after their “arrest.”
Then it rained from morning until night,
and they progressed through water and mud,
which cut down their speed.</p>

<p>They were dry and fairly comfortable, however,
for the closed car was as snug as a bungalow,
and they could cook and sleep inside. Then
the weather cleared, and, save for muddy roads,
there was no discomfort.</p>

<p>“And we seem to have given Noddy the slip,”
remarked Jerry, one day, for they had neither
seen nor heard anything of their enemy or his
companions. “We’re having fine luck.”</p>

<p>They had been traveling by auto over a week,
and were getting close to Denver, whence they
would make the rest of the trip by airship, when
there came a turn in the good fortune that had, so
far, accompanied them.</p>

<p>They were going down a hill, one evening into
a little town when the foot brake unexpectedly
broke, and they started off at a rapid pace. Jerry,
however, quickly threw in the emergency, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
brought the car up before any harm had resulted.</p>

<p>“Hum! This is a nice pickle!” exclaimed the
tall lad. “Now we’ve got to lay over until this is
fixed.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can have it fixed over night,” suggested
Ned. “There’s a combined blacksmith
shop and garage just ahead,” and he pointed to
it. “If we pay extra we can have the man work
all night on the brake, and have it ready for us
in the morning. There must be some sort of a
hotel here, where we can put up.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” cried Bob. “Then I won’t have to
cook supper.”</p>

<p>“No, but you’ll eat it,” said Jerry. “But I
guess Ned’s plan is a good one.”</p>

<p>The blacksmith, who also did auto repair work,
agreed, for an extra fee, to put in the night fixing
the brake, and the car being left at his shop, the
boys went to the only hotel in the village of Lafayette.</p>

<p>“Here’s the register,” spoke the landlord,
handing over the book to the boys and the professor.
“Supper’ll soon be ready.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” murmured Bob, and his chums
laughed as they advanced to sign their names. As
Jerry put his down first, he uttered a cry of surprise,
and pointed to the signatures just above
where theirs were to go.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Ned, looking over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
his chum’s shoulder. “Noddy Nixon, and Bill
Berry! They were here a couple of days ago!”</p>

<p>“And that must be the mysterious man who
was with them,” added Jerry, pointing to the signature
of Dr. Kirk Belgrade.</p>

<p>“Kirk Belgrade! Kirk Belgrade!” murmured
Professor Snodgrass, as he saw the signature.
“Where have I heard that name before? Where
have I seen that face?” He was in deep thought
for a moment, and then he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, I have it! Belgrade. Yes, he was an instructor
at my college a few years ago. A smart
man, but he did some underhand work, and he
was asked to resign. The last I heard of him he
had started a sort of mushroom correspondence
school. Poor Belgrade! He was a brilliant
scholar, but he wanted to live by his wits, instead
of working.”</p>

<p>“What can he be doing with Noddy?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“Give it up,” murmured Bob. “I wonder
when supper will be ready, and what we’ll have to
eat?”</p>

<p>Jerry was in deep thought.</p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass,” he asked suddenly,
“what branch of science did this Dr. Belgrade
teach in college?”</p>

<p>“Well, his specialty was electricity, and I remember
when radium was first discovered that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
he took a great interest in it. He even wrote a
paper on it, that was considered very good. Another
thing, though perhaps I should not speak of
it. Our college had a small specimen of radium,
that one of the founders bought, and presented to
the laboratory. One day it disappeared, and it
was the same day Belgrade was asked to resign.</p>

<p>“There was talk that he might know something
about it, but the faculty considered that he
had disgraced our school enough by something
else he did, so they did not press the radium
matter. Belgrade sold examination papers to
some of the students. He was too brilliant, I’m
afraid, for his own good. And now to think he is
in with Noddy Nixon!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I believe I know what for!” exclaimed
Jerry. “Noddy has taken him along as
an authority on radium, for Noddy wouldn’t know
it from a lump of clay. I begin to see things now.
Fellows, we’ve got to be on our guard. I wish
Noddy was behind us instead of ahead of us!”</p>

<p>“Why, do you think he’ll get to Snake Island
before we do?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“He may,” replied Jerry grimly. “But he’ll
have his work cut out to beat us. I wish that
brake hadn’t smashed. I’d like to be traveling
now.”</p>

<p>But there was no help for it. They had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
wait until morning, and then they took to the road
again. For two days more they traveled on and
then, unexpectedly running out of gasolene one
night they had to lay over again for a half hour
while the garage dealer supplied them. He was
out, too, but the tank wagon, with a supply was on
its way, he said.</p>

<p>“Had another auto here, a while ago, and they
took my last gallon,” explained the garage attendant.
“Fellow by the name of Blixen, or something
like that. Mighty fresh, too. He wanted
to beat me down on my price.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it Nixon, and not Blixen?” asked
Jerry quickly.</p>

<p>“Well, that might have been it. I didn’t pay
much attention. His auto was badly in need of
repairs, and I sort of asked if he didn’t want me
to fix it. He said he didn’t as they were only going
on a little farther.”</p>

<p>“A little farther,” remarked Jerry, for it was
still some distance to Denver, where Noddy was
undoubtedly headed for. It was common knowledge
that the <i>Comet</i>, the airship of our heroes,
was in Denver, for the papers had contained many
accounts of how it had broken records at the big
meet. Noddy could not have helped seeing them,
and, naturally, he would suspect that the motor
boys were going to pick up their craft.</p>

<p>“Well, he said he and his crowd were going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
take a train the rest of the way,” went on the garage
man. “They were going to Belmont station,
and take the train there. Here comes the gasolene.
I’ll soon have your tanks filled.”</p>

<p>“Fellows, we’ve got to do something!” exclaimed
Jerry to his companions, as the gasolene
was being put in. “Noddy may get ahead of us
after all, and reach Denver first, if he takes a
train.”</p>

<p>“What can we do?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Leave the auto, and take a train ourselves,”
replied the tall lad.</p>

<p>“That’s it!” cried Bob. “Beat him at his
own game!”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll do it,” decided Jerry. “How far
is it to Belmont?” he asked of the garage man,
as he paid for the gasolene.</p>

<p>“About twenty miles.”</p>

<p>“Can you get a through train there for Denver,
Colorado?”</p>

<p>“No, only locals stop there. But if you want
to go to Denver, I can tell you a better way. Why
don’t you go to Meldon station. That’s only ten
miles farther on, and the Denver Limited stops
there. You can make it I guess,” and he looked
at his watch. “She leaves there at nine o’clock
to-night, and it’s one of the few stops until she hits
Denver. You can only get locals at Belmont. The
Limited beats them all to pieces.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll do it!” cried Jerry. “Come on, fellows!
On to Meldon!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to travel pretty fast,” the man
warned them. “And the roads aren’t very good—especially
at night.”</p>

<p>“We can do it!” cried Jerry. “Meldon for
ours, and we’ll beat Noddy on his local!”</p>

<p>They were soon chugging down the road, in
the gathering darkness. Bob started to get supper,
when Jerry stopped a little later to light the
powerful gas lamps, and then they went on at increased
speed. Jerry drove the car as fast as was
safe, but their bad luck pursued them, for they
took the wrong turn at a point five miles from
Meldon, and went eight miles out of their way.</p>

<p>“Oh hang it!” cried Ned when they were set
right by a truck farmer on a load of produce.
“Can we make it, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” and the tall lad threw the gasolene
lever over a couple more notches, and advanced
the spark full.</p>

<p>The big car fairly bounded along, and it
seemed as if they would get to Meldon in time to
catch the Limited. But they struck a stretch of
sand that held them back. However, Jerry drove
on like mad, and soon the lights of the station
came into view.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with the car?”
cried Ned above the noise of the motor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“Leave it with the agent, and have him store
it for us,” replied Jerry. “I guess we’re in
plenty of time, fellows,” he cried with a look at
his watch. “I thought it was later.”</p>

<p>He stopped the car with a screech of brakes at
the station, and jumped out.</p>

<p>“You fellows get out the baggage, and I’ll see
to the tickets!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Don’t leave any of my specimens!” cried the
professor.</p>

<p>Jerry rushed up to the ticket agent behind his
little barred window.</p>

<p>“Four tickets through to Denver!” exclaimed
the tall lad. “On the Limited! We’ve got quite
some baggage and I’d like to leave our auto in
your care. We’ll pay you well.”</p>

<p>“The Limited pulled out of here about an hour
ago,” said the man. “You’re too late.”</p>

<p>“Too late? Why it isn’t nine o’clock yet!”
and Jerry looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“Guess you must be wrong, friend,” spoke the
agent. “That clock is standard time for this
section of the country.”</p>

<p>Jerry looked at his watch and gave a low
whistle.</p>

<p>“By Jove! She’s stopped,” he cried. “That’s
it. I forgot to wind my watch last night. Oh,
what a chump!”</p>

<p>“Then we’ve missed the Limited,” said Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“And Noddy Nixon is ahead of us,” added
Bob.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so,” admitted Jerry, a look of disappointment
on his face. “Has the local from
Belmont gone?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Some time ago,” replied the agent. “She
doesn’t stop here. The Limited will have passed
her by now, though.”</p>

<p>The boys said nothing. They did not know
what to do. Their enemy was ahead of them, and
they were stranded. The professor was calmly
looking for bugs on the wall of the depot.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>THE PROFESSOR’S LUNCH</small></h2>


<p>“Well, what are we going to do?” asked
Ned, after a long and rather gloomy pause.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Jerry.</p>

<p>“Might as well go on in the auto,” suggested
Bob. “We’ll get to Denver to-morrow or next
day, won’t we?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” agreed the tall lad, “but Noddy
will be a good deal ahead of us, even if he is on a
slow local. Hang it! Why didn’t I think to wind
my watch. I meant to, but we had so many
things to think about that it slipped my mind.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no use crying over spilled milk,”
consoled Ned. “The thing now is to decide
what’s best to do. We might have looked at our
watches.”</p>

<p>The station agent had gone outside to attend to
some of his duties, leaving the boys and the professor
alone in the depot. The scientist seemed
to have shaken all cares from his shoulders, as he
walked about, peering through his powerful spectacles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
for any stray specimens he might be able to
capture.</p>

<p>“Well, the only thing I see,” spoke Jerry, “is
to take the Limited to-morrow. We can stay here
in town to-night. I guess we’ll go to a hotel, for
I want to stretch out in bed. Then I can arrange
with some garage man myself, about looking after
the auto, instead of leaving it for the station
agent to do. But I certainly am sorry we missed
that train. We’d be ahead of Noddy by this
time.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t your fault any more than it was
ours,” spoke Ned. “We ought to have looked at
our watches, too.”</p>

<p>Bob said nothing. He had strolled over to the
far side of the depot where there was a lunch
counter. But the place was closed by glass partitions,
through which the food could be seen.</p>

<p>“Just look at Chunky,” said Ned in a low
tone.</p>

<p>“Here, come away from there!” called Jerry
in a loud voice to his chum. “Hands off!”</p>

<p>Bob started.</p>

<p>“Can’t I look at it if I want to?” he asked.
“I was seeing if they had any nicer stuff than we
did in the auto. If they did we might better eat
here instead of going to the hotel. Supper’ll be
over there, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Come away, or you’ll get wireless indigestion,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
advised Jerry. “Oh, say, I wish I knew
what to do,” he added impatiently.</p>

<p>“Guess the only thing is to go to bed and take
the first train in the morning,” advised Ned.</p>

<p>At that moment a young woman came into the
depot. She walked with a business-like air, and,
advancing to the lunch room, opened the door
leading into it. Then she began taking down the
glass windows that closed it off. Bob, who had
walked back toward his chums, started for the
counter again.</p>

<p>“Would you look at Chunky!” remarked Ned
again. The stout lad was eagerly looking over
the collection of food, at the same time casting
stray glances at the young woman—she was little
more than a girl.</p>

<p>“Are—are you going to serve lunch?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“If anybody wants it—and I hope they do,”
was her reply with a bright smile, showing two
rows of white, even teeth.</p>

<p>“I—I guess I do,” went on Bob, with a half-ashamed
glance at his chums.</p>

<p>“Here, Bob! You come away from there!”
ordered Ned in a loud voice. “Don’t go to bothering
the young lady. You mustn’t mind him,
miss,” went on the joking Ned. “He’s harmless.
We’re taking him back to the asylum. He just
got out to-day—escaped. He thinks he’s always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
hungry. Did he annoy you?” and with a half-fierce
air Ned started for Bob.</p>

<p>“No—no, sir, he didn’t say anything out of the
way,” replied the girl, with a startled air.</p>

<p>“Well, he doesn’t mean anything,” explained
Ned without a smile. “He always imagines he’s
hungry. That’s his peculiar form of insanity.
You wouldn’t believe it, but he just ate three roast
chickens, not half an hour ago, and my partner
and I have had the hardest work to prevent him
breaking into your lunch room. Come over here,
I say, or we’ll put the strait-jacket on you!”
ordered Ned to his fat chum.</p>

<p>For a moment Bob could only gasp, he was so
surprised. Then he ripped out:</p>

<p>“Well of all the nerve! I’ll fix you for that!
Don’t you believe him!” he went on. “I’m not
crazy at all, I’m only hungry.”</p>

<p>“They all say that,” put in Jerry, carrying on
the joke.</p>

<p>“Jerry Hopkins!” cried Bob. “I—I’ll——”</p>

<p>He did not say what he would do, for at that
moment Professor Snodgrass, who had been unsuccessful
in his search for insects, approached
the lunch counter. The girl had started the coffee
machine, and an aromatic odor filled the waiting
room.</p>

<p>“Ah, that smells good!” exclaimed the professor.
“I believe I will have a cup of coffee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and some sandwiches. Will you join me, boys,
as long as we have to wait?”</p>

<p>“Yes, do,” urged Bob, and he glanced appealingly
at his chums. They did not have the heart
to plague him further, and with a laugh, at which
the girl seemed much relieved, Jerry clapped his
stout companion on the back, and linked arms
with him.</p>

<p>“I believe I can take something myself,” spoke
Ned. “Bob, you do the ordering, and then we’ll
go to the hotel, and try to forget our troubles in
sleep.”</p>

<p>They drew the tall stools up to the marble-topped
lunch counter, and the girl, evidently much
relieved, and pleased at so many customers at that
hour, began setting out plates, spoons, knifes and
other table utensils in front of them.</p>

<p>“Chicken pies!” exclaimed Bob, rubbing his
hands as he scanned the bill of fare. “That
sounds good. We’ll start with them.”</p>

<p>“I think I will take some fruit first,” said the
professor. “Those bananas look tempting,” and
he motioned to some under a glass cover.</p>

<p>“Just help yourself to them, please,” invited
the lunch girl. “I’ll put the chicken pies in the
oven to heat.”</p>

<p>Mr. Snodgrass lifted the cover off the bananas,
and, as he did so he uttered one of his usual cries
of delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“There it is! There it is!” he exclaimed.
“Oh, what a beauty, and such a long tail! Oh,
I must get that! Look out boys! Don’t let it
get away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what is it?” screamed the girl. “It’s a
mouse, I know it is! Oh, a mouse! A mouse!
Father, come quickly!” and she leaped upon a
small stool, and thence to the broad shelf back of
the lunch counter, while Professor Snodgrass
clapped a specimen box down over something amid
the bananas.</p>

<small>THE WRECK OF THE LIMITED</small></h2>


<p>The door of the station opened, and the ticket
agent rushed in. At a glance he sized up the situation,
the girl on the shelf, screaming, the excited
professor holding his hands over the bananas and
three more or less startled boys looking on.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” demanded the agent.
“Mildred, has anything happened? Have these
people annoyed you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, father. It’s a mouse—a mouse in the
bananas, but the gentleman has captured it. But
he acted so queer—he called out so, and—and——”
She stopped, on the verge of tears.</p>

<p>The agent took a step forward. His manner
was rather threatening. Jerry saw that it was
time to explain at once.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” he said in a quiet voice. “We
did start to have a little fun with our friend,” and
he nodded at Bob, “but we had no intention of
annoying the young lady. We——”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, they didn’t annoy me, father,” the
girl said earnestly. “It’s only the mouse.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a mouse at all!” broke in the professor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
“It is a very rare specimen of a long-tailed
scorpion and——”</p>

<p>“Oh, a scorpion!” screamed the girl. “That’s
worse! Oh, daddy, get a poker, or something,
and kill the horrid thing. I saw one once, all
covered with long hairs—a big spider—Ugh!”</p>

<p>“You are thinking of a tarantula, my dear
young lady,” said the professor calmly. “This is
a scorpion, which is entirely different. But this
species is harmless, I do assure you. It wouldn’t
bite a fly. I am very fortunate to have captured
it. I saw it on the bananas as soon as I took off
the cover, and I knew I must get it at once, or it
would escape. There, I have it safe,” and he slid
a glass cover on the box, and held out to view
some sort of an insect, like a crayfish, with an extra
long tail, which was squirming about under
the glass.</p>

<p>“There is the little beauty!” cried the professor
with enthusiasm. “It is worth at least ten
dollars, and I am willing to pay that much to whoever
owns it,” and he glanced at the girl.</p>

<p>“Ugh! Take the horrid thing away!” she
cried. “Are you sure there are no more?”</p>

<p>“Not a one. I wish there were,” said the professor,
looking carefully among the bananas.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll come down,” went on the lunch
girl, as she blushingly descended. “I’m sorry I
made a scene, but I thought it was a mouse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s all right,” spoke Jerry gallantly. “It
was our fault for wanting lunch at this unearthly
hour.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I always serve lunch at this time,” spoke
the girl. “There’s quite a crowd comes in from
the Denver Express, and they’re ’most always
hungry. They’ll be here in about an hour, won’t
they, father? Is the train on time?”</p>

<p>“About,” replied the agent. “But I don’t exactly
understand. Is everything all right now?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” said Jerry, and he explained how
he and Ned had started to have fun with Bob,
how they had made up their minds to have a
lunch, and how Professor Snodgrass had discovered
the scorpion amid the bananas. He told
what a learned man the scientist was, always on
the lookout for specimens. Uriah Snodgrass was,
by this time, painlessly preserving his scorpion,
and making notes about it, forgetting his desire to
eat. Not so Bob, however, who was eagerly waiting
for the hot chicken pies.</p>

<p>The excitement soon quieted down, and matters
having been satisfactorily explained the ticket
agent became very friendly. He told the boys
how he had secured the privilege of running the
lunch counter at the station, and how his daughter,
after the death of her mother, had taken
charge of it. By this time the meal was ready,
and even the professor sat up and ate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I don’t see why you serve meals so late,”
said Jerry, for it was now after ten o’clock.</p>

<p>“Oh, we have to accommodate the passengers
of the Denver Express,” explained Miss Harrison,
the lunch-girl. “At least they call it an express,
though it doesn’t go very fast.”</p>

<p>“And it comes from Denver?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No, it goes <em>to</em> Denver,” she said.</p>

<p>“To Denver?” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s the last train out of here to-night.
It gets to Denver to-morrow noon, when it’s on
time, and that isn’t very often. But there are
always a lot of travelers who like to stop off here
for lunch. The train waits ten minutes for a
freight to clear. So I always come back here
after supper to serve a little lunch. I won’t have
much left, though, if you people come in often,”
and with a mischievous look on her face she
glanced at Bob.</p>

<p>“A train to Denver!” cried Jerry. “That’s
good news. I didn’t know there were any more.
I supposed when we lost the Limited we were
stranded here for the night. Boys, there’s a
chance yet of beating Noddy Nixon!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Ned. “Then we’ll do
it.”</p>

<p>“Sure—we—blub—ugh—will,” added Bob,
his mouth full of chicken pie.</p>

<p>“Then finish up!” ordered Jerry. “We’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
arrange to have the auto left here, and take our
baggage on with us. In Denver to-morrow noon!
That’s fine!”</p>

<p>“If you’re on time,” put in the agent. “I
meant to tell you about that last train, but I had
some freight matters to look after, and it slipped
my mind. She’ll be along here pretty soon. Better
get your tickets, and have your baggage
checked if you’re going.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we’ve got to attend to our auto,”
said Jerry.</p>

<p>“And my specimens!” cried the professor.
“I think I will express back to the college those
I have, and begin on a new lot. Oh, how lucky
I am to get the long-tailed scorpion!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t speak of it!” cried Miss Harrison.</p>

<p>While Ned ran the auto to the nearest garage
and arranged to have it cared for while the boys
were in the West, Jerry and Bob bought the
tickets for Denver, and had the baggage checked.
That is, Jerry did most of the work, while Bob
paid occasional visits to the lunch counter.</p>

<p>“Say, Bob,” asked Jerry at length. “Is it
the girl or the grub that you’re fondest of?”</p>

<p>“Ah—er—both!” stammered the fat lad.
“Those chicken pies were fine!”</p>

<p>There was some little time to wait after all
their preparations were made, for the Express<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
was late, as usual, and in the interim the boys
and the professor struck up quite an acquaintance
with Mr. Harrison and his daughter. Bob even
insisted on buying a lot of sandwiches to take
along on the train, for he said he might get hungry
in the night journey to Denver.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s better than staying in town all
night,” remarked Jerry, when the agent informed
him that their train would soon pull in. “But I
wish we had caught the Limited.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe we’ll get ahead of Noddy yet,”
suggested Ned.</p>

<p>The Express pulled in, and a score of hungry
passengers besieged pretty Miss Harrison. She
waved good-bye to the boys and the professor,
and then began handing out food. Our friends
got aboard, and settled themselves comfortably
for the trip to Denver. At last they were underway
again.</p>

<p>Through the night rushed the Express. Jerry
and his friends had taken sleeping berths, and
they stretched out for a long rest, as they were
tired. There was some regret that Noddy was
ahead of them, but this could not be helped.</p>

<p>“What do you think Noddy will do when he
gets to Denver; if he arrives ahead of us?” asked
Ned of Jerry, who had the berth below him.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I hope he doesn’t find out
where our airship is, and try to damage that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“He wouldn’t dare!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Noddy would do anything. Still, there’s
no use in worrying until we have to.”</p>

<p>“Say, will you boys get quiet and go to sleep?”
begged a nervous man across the aisle. “I’ve
got to get up early.”</p>

<p>“Sorry we disturbed you,” spoke Jerry.
“Good-night, Ned.”</p>

<p>“Good-night.”</p>

<p>“Thank goodness!” grunted the fussy man.</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. Then, from
the berth just forward of Jerry, came an inquiry.</p>

<p>“Jerry, did you see what I did with that specimen
of the long-tailed scorpion?”</p>

<p>“Oh, mercy!” screamed a woman from somewhere
in the car. “I hate bugs!”</p>

<p>“You expressed it back to the college with the
other things, Professor Snodgrass,” answered the
tall lad.</p>

<p>“Oh, so I did. Good-night.”</p>

<p>“Good-night.”</p>

<p>“Thank goodness!” grunted the fussy man.</p>

<p>There was silence throughout the sleeping car.
The train swung on through the night, making
occasional stops. Then came a long run.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a grinding of brakes. The
train was halted so suddenly that many of the
passengers slipped down to the ends of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
berths, all crumpled up. There was a series of
shrill whistles.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” cried the fussy man.
“Are you boys cutting up again? Can’t you let
a man sleep in peace? I’ve got to get up early!”</p>

<p>“Hello! Hello!” cried the professor. “What
is it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Jerry. “It isn’t
us, anyhow,” he added, for the benefit of the
fussy man.</p>

<p>Just then a brakeman came hurrying through
the car.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked Jerry, poking his head
through the curtains of his berth.</p>

<p>“Wreck!” was the brief reply. “The Denver
Limited, right ahead of us, has jumped the
track. Our engineer stopped just in time, or we’d
have been into her.”</p>

<p>“The Limited wrecked!” gasped Jerry. “It’s
a good thing, after all, that we missed it!”</p>

<p>Then, from somewhere ahead, came screams
and cries, and the crash of axes on wood.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>THE EXPRESS AHEAD</small></h2>


<p>“Come on, fellows, tumble out!”</p>

<p>Thus Jerry called to his two chums, but they
needed no urging. The curtains of their berths
were violently shaken as the lads drew on their
clothes, and leaped out into the aisle.</p>

<p>“Has anything happened?” asked the professor,
hardly awake, even after his first question.</p>

<p>“Not to us,” answered Jerry. “Our luck
seems to have turned. But there must be a lot
of people badly hurt on the Limited. Come on,
we’ll do all we can to help.”</p>

<p>Without stopping to dress fully, the three boys
hurried out of the car. The professor and some
of the other men passengers followed, the women
remaining in frightened and tearful groups, discussing
what had happened.</p>

<p>Jerry saw a brakeman hurrying from the
sleeping car with several tools under his arm—an
axe, a saw and a crowbar.</p>

<p>“Are passengers imprisoned in the wreck?”
asked the tall lad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“Some of ’em,” was the quick response. “We
need all the help we can get. There weren’t many
on the Limited, and what few there are can’t do
anything. It’s a good thing her tail lights were
burning, or we’d have smashed into her. Come
along, boys.”</p>

<p>“Say, we’re right in the woods,” remarked
Ned as he stumbled along the track in the darkness.
Ahead of them they could see a glow of
flames, reflected from the dark trees.</p>

<p>“It’s on fire!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s why we need all the help we can get
to chop the people out!” cried the brakeman.
“Here, you boys, take those tools, and run ahead
with ’em. I’ll get more from some of the other
cars.”</p>

<p>Jerry caught up a saw, Ned the iron bar and
Bob the axe.</p>

<p>“Isn’t there anything for me?” demanded the
professor, who was anxious to help.</p>

<p>“You’ll find more tools up ahead!” shouted
the brakeman, with a wave of his hand toward the
blazing wreck. “Hurry!”</p>

<p>The screams and cries of the injured could be
heard more plainly now, and the fire was burning
brighter. The three boys hastened their pace,
and Jerry headed for one car, around which most
of the rescuers were grouped.</p>

<p>“Here’s work for us, fellows!” he cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s right!” shouted a brakeman. “Get
busy!”</p>

<p>The motor boys could see the havoc wrought
by the wreck. The engine lay on its side, down a
slight embankment, and one car—a combined mail
and express coach—had followed. The other
cars were on the track, with the exception of one,
which had fallen on its side, and was partly
smashed. It was from this coach that the cries
were proceeding, but fortunately that was not the
car that was burning. The one on fire was an
express car.</p>

<p>“There are people imprisoned in this car!”
cried the conductor of the train, who was directing
operations. “Chop and saw away at the windows,
so we can get ’em out! Lively now, everybody!”</p>

<p>“But the fire!” cried a man, pointing to the
express car. “Hadn’t we better try to put that
out?”</p>

<p>“Can’t be done,” replied the conductor briefly.
“We have no water.”</p>

<p>“But the poor souls——” cried the man.</p>

<p>“None in there,” was the quick answer. “The
express messenger got out, and the stuff will have
to burn. All the people in danger are in this
car, and we’ve got to get ’em out. There’s no
danger from the fire. It will have to burn out.
Lively now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys fell to with a will, as did the other
passengers from the wrecked Limited and from
the Express. Several of the unfortunates had already
been rescued, and were being laid on the
cushioned car seats, or carried back to the rear
train.</p>

<p>“Here’s someone under this window!” cried
Jerry, as in the darkness, illuminated by the glow
from the fire, he saw a white hand tapping on the
glass, that had, through some strange agency, not
broken.</p>

<p>“Chop ’em out!” cried Bob, raising his axe.</p>

<p>“Go easy there!” yelled Jerry. “You’ll do
more harm than good!” The tall lad tapped
on the pane, and a face was thrust close to it.</p>

<p>“Protect yourself from the flying glass,” ordered
Jerry. “We’re going to break it, and pull
you out. Cover yourself up.”</p>

<p>A few taps with the axe served to shatter the
pane, after Jerry had noticed that the dim figure
wrapped itself in a blanket, for this car was a
sleeper. Soon the hole was big enough to haul
out a fairly large person, and Jerry and Ned
carefully scraped away the jagged points of
glass.</p>

<p>“Come on now!” cried Jerry, thrusting his
hands down into the opening. “We’ll lift you
out!”</p>

<p>He caught hold of the wrist of someone, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Ned the other hand. They lifted, and there
came into view a little girl, with light, curly hair.
She did not seem to have a scratch on her, but
she was crying from fright. As soon as Jerry
had her in his arms she screamed out:</p>

<p>“Oh, where is mamma—and papa?”</p>

<p>A man came bursting through the crowd at the
sound of the child’s voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, Gladys! Thank the dear Lord!” he
cried, fairly snatching her from Jerry. “You are
saved! I thought you were gone! Your mamma
is safe. Come. Oh, boys, I can’t thank you
enough! You have saved my little daughter.”</p>

<p>“And the glass didn’t cut me!” cried Gladys.
“I was in a blanket. But, papa, I can’t go. Annabell
is in there.”</p>

<p>“What, another little girl!” cried Jerry.
“Come on, boys. More work!”</p>

<p>“Annabell is my doll!” explained Gladys,
smiling now in her father’s arms. “But I want
her. I love her.”</p>

<p>Jerry looked in through the broken window.
In a pile of blankets, on what had been a berth,
he saw what seemed to be a tousled head of hair.
Reaching in his arm he pulled out a big doll,
minus one leg.</p>

<p>“Oh, poor Annabell is hurt!” cried Gladys.
“Oh, papa!”</p>

<p>“Never mind, you shall have a dozen dolls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Boys, I can’t begin to thank you! Montrose is
my name, James Montrose, of Denver. I’ll see
you again. I want your names. Now I must
take Gladys to her mother. Mrs. Montrose is
slightly injured. Oh, what a terrible wreck!”</p>

<p>He hurried away, and Jerry and his chums
looked for more work to do. But, so well had
the rescue operations been conducted that, as far
as could be learned, not another soul remained in
the wrecked sleeper. From the other cars the
passengers had hastened themselves, or been
helped, after the crash, bruises and cuts being
their worst injuries.</p>

<p>And, strange as it may seem, no one was killed
outright, though several were grievously hurt.
The wounded had been carried back to the stalled
Express, and made as comfortable as possible.
Fortunately, there was a doctor aboard, and a
supply of bandages and medicine. The conductor
of the wrecked Limited checked over his passenger
list, and reported no one missing.</p>

<p>“I think everyone is out now, gentlemen,” he
said to Jerry and his chums, and the little group
of rescuers.</p>

<p>“Then I suppose we must wait here until the
wrecking crew comes,” said one man.</p>

<p>“No,” answered the conductor, “we will go
back, and get aboard the Express, just behind us.
There is a switch, not far away, and we can go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
around the wreck, and proceed to Denver, though
we’ll stop at the nearest hospital with the worst
wounded.”</p>

<p>“On to Denver!” exclaimed Jerry. “Then
we’ll beat the Limited after all. We’re going
on ahead.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but Noddy is still in front of us,” spoke
Ned in a low voice. “We’ll never catch up to
him.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be helped,” remarked Bob. “Say,
but we run into excitement and adventures when
we least expect it.”</p>

<p>“That’s better than running into a wreck,” replied
Jerry. “Hello, here’s someone evidently
forgotten!”</p>

<p>The boys and Professor Snodgrass were walking
back toward the Express, and were somewhat
by themselves, when Jerry noticed the figure of a
man lying on a pile of seat cushions on the railroad
embankment.</p>

<p>“Let’s carry him back to the doctor!” cried
Ned, and he advanced to take hold of one corner
of the seat, which was like an improvised
stretcher. The man on it never moved.</p>

<p>“We four can carry it nicely,” said Jerry.
“Catch hold here, Professor.”</p>

<p>Mr. Snodgrass used one hand to reach for the
corner of the plush-covered seat. His left he held
clenched, some distance away from his body. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
might have been expected, with only one hand, he
could not lift his corner.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Ned. “Is your
hand hurt, Mr. Snodgrass?”</p>

<p>“Hand hurt? No. Why?”</p>

<p>“You’re not using it. Why do you hold it
that funny way?”</p>

<p>“Funny way? I—er—bless my soul! It’s
my collar button. I’ve been holding my collar
button all this while. I started to put it in my
shirt when I heard the call for help, and I guess
I was so excited and absent-minded that I’ve been
holding it ever since. I wondered why I couldn’t
do more work, and all the while it was because I
only used one hand. The other held the collar
button. How stupid!”</p>

<p>He thrust the button into his pocket, while the
boys could hardly restrain a smile. Then, with
the professor’s two-handed aid, the sufferer on
the seat was carried to the rear. He had fainted
from a comparatively slight injury and was soon
being cared for.</p>

<p>A little later, with all the wounded from the
Limited on board, and all the other passengers
squeezed in somehow, the Express backed up, went
around the wreck by means of a switch, and
headed for Denver.</p>

<p>The boys were beating the Limited, which they
had missed, but they would reach the Western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
city considerably in the rear of Noddy Nixon for
all that, since the Limited could not now pass the
local train on which the bully and his cronies were
riding.</p>

<p>“Well, it can’t be helped,” remarked Jerry,
as he saw Mr. Montrose, whose little daughter
they had rescued, caring for his wife. Gladys
was happy with her injured doll.</p>

<small>THE AIRSHIP GONE</small></h2>


<p>Stopping in the early dawn at a good-sized
city, the wounded from the Express were taken to
a hospital for treatment. Though Mrs. Montrose
was not seriously hurt her husband decided
that she also had better stop off, instead of making
the trip to Denver. Accordingly, after having
bidden the boys good-bye, giving them his address
in the Western city, and telling them he
expected to see them there, Mr. Montrose got
off the train.</p>

<p>“And I’m much obliged to you, too,” said little
Gladys. “So Annabell would be, if she could
talk, and I guess she doesn’t mind her leg being
off—that is, not very much, for she’s been asleep
most of the time, and when you sleep you don’t
feel any pain.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s right,” agreed Jerry with a
smile.</p>

<p>The Express went on, but it was much behind
time, and had to proceed necessarily slower each
hour, on account of the wreck, for all the railroad
schedules were set awry.</p>

<p>“But we’ll get there some time,” observed
Jerry, though naturally he was nervous about
what Noddy might do to get to Snake Island
ahead of them.</p>

<p>Noon saw our friends still quite a distance away
from Denver, and they fretted over the delay.
They ate dinner at a way-station lunch counter,
and, though Professor Snodgrass looked eagerly
among the bananas for more rare specimens, he
found none.</p>

<p>“But if I get my two-tailed toad I’ll not want
anything else,” he said, as they got underway
again.</p>

<p>It was late that afternoon, when they reached
Denver, and went at once to a hotel, for a good
bath and a change of clothing, for they had
brought their big valises with them on the
train.</p>

<p>“And now for a good hot meal!” cried Bob,
as, much refreshed the chums sat together in the
hotel parlor. “Railroad lunches are all right,
even when a pretty girl serves ’em, but I want to
sit down to a table where I can eat as long as I
like.”</p>

<p>“And as much,” added Jerry. “But I guess
we’ll have to postpone our eating for a while,
Bob,” and the tall lad winked at Ned.</p>

<p>“Postpone it!” cried the fat youth. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, we ought to go out to Buffalo Park, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
look after our airship,” went on Jerry. The
<i>Comet</i>, so Mr. Glassford had written them, was
left at one of the hangars in Buffalo Park, where
the aero meet had been held. The craft had not
been taken apart for shipment back east, but
had, in accordance with the instructions of the
motor boys, been kept in readiness for a quick
flight. A watchman, named Boise, had been left
in charge, and Mr. Glassford had told him that
Jerry and his chums would soon be on hand to
claim their property.</p>

<p>“Go to Buffalo Park!” exclaimed Bob blankly.
“Why, that’s about seven miles out. It will take
more than two hours to go there and back, and
look at the <i>Comet</i>. That will make supper awfully
late. I guess she’s all right. Can’t we wait
until to-morrow, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what I was going to propose,”
remarked the tall lad, after what to Bob was a
painful pause. “I guess we’re all too tired to
chase out there, and our airship will probably
be all right. I tried to see if I could get Boise
on the ’phone, but I couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go out there the first thing in the morning!”
decided Bob, with a look of relief on his
face. “Now, I’m going to the dining-room, and
look at the bill of fare.”</p>

<p>“Don’t eat it,” advised Ned with a laugh.</p>

<p>“No danger. I’m not going to spoil my appetite,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
declared the fat one. “I never had a better.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t say anything about it, or they’ll
raise the rate on us,” cautioned Jerry. “Jove,
but I’m tired!” and he stretched out in an easy
chair, while Ned took another, and Bob strolled
toward the dining-room, to find out how soon
supper would be served.</p>

<p>“And we didn’t hear anything of Noddy,” remarked
Ned, after a pause.</p>

<p>“Nor see anything,” added Jerry. “I inquired
at the station, and they told me the local,
which Noddy and the others must have taken, got
in early this morning. He was several hours
ahead of us if he was on that, and he probably
was.”</p>

<p>Bright and early the next morning they were
on their way to Buffalo Park. The place of the
aero meet was deserted, and the hangars looked
gloomy in the big expanse of open field.</p>

<p>“Wonder which is ours?” ventured Ned, as
he and his chums alighted from the trolley car.</p>

<p>“There it is,” remarked Jerry, pointing to a
big shed with the word “COMET” in large letters
across the big doors.</p>

<p>“And now for a good flight!” cried Bob. “No
more train wrecks for ours. Off for Snake Island
and the radium!”</p>

<p>“And my two-tailed toad,” added Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Snodgrass, looking carefully on the ground as he
advanced for a possible rare specimen.</p>

<p>The boys found the hangar, where their craft
was housed, closed and locked. They pounded
on the doors, and Jerry remarked:</p>

<p>“This is odd.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Because Mr. Glassford said he had instructed
Boise to just live out here until we came—not to
go away at all. And yet he isn’t here.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he didn’t expect us, and has gone to
town for supplies,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“In that case, as Mr. Glassford wrote, he was
to have a friend on guard. Yet no one seems to
be here.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s asleep,” ventured Bob.</p>

<p>Jerry kicked on the door, with enough force to
awaken the soundest sleeper, but there was no
response from inside. Suddenly, from the fields
back of the boys came a hail.</p>

<p>“Hey! What are you fellows doing at that
hangar? Get away!”</p>

<p>A man came running toward them. He seemed
quite angry.</p>

<p>“Get away!” he ordered.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” asked Jerry, a sudden fear
coming into his heart.</p>

<p>“I’m the watchman—Boise is my name—but
I’m on my way to Denver now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why?” faltered Ned.</p>

<p>“Because there’s nothing more here to watch.
My job is ended. But who are you fellows, anyhow;
and what do you want here?”</p>

<p>“We’re the owners of the <i>Comet</i>,” replied
Jerry, “and we came for our airship, that Mr.
Glassford left with you.”</p>

<p>“The—the owners!” gasped Mr. Boise.
“Are you the motor boys?”</p>

<p>“We are!” cried Ned. “Where is the
<i>Comet</i>?”</p>

<p>“It’s gone—gone!” faltered the watchman.</p>

<p>“Gone; where?” Jerry wanted to know.</p>

<p>“I delivered it to a young fellow named Noddy
Nixon last night,” answered Mr. Boise. “He
had a letter from Mr. Glassford, and one signed
Jerry Hopkins, saying he had been sent to bring
the airship to you—said you couldn’t get this far,
as there was a wreck.”</p>

<p>“Noddy—Nixon—has—our—airship!”
gasped Jerry. “Fellows, he got ahead of us
after all!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>AN UNEXPECTED OFFER</small></h2>


<p>Blank amazement, despair, fear and anger
showed on the faces of the motor boys, as they
looked at one another and then at the watchman,
Boise. The latter, no less than our heroes, was
startled. He saw at once that something was
wrong.</p>

<p>“And you let the airship go—our <i>Comet</i>?”
asked Jerry, as if he could not believe the words.</p>

<p>“I did. I thought it was all right. This
Noddy Nixon said he was a friend of yours, and
he had two letters. They were orders on me to
give up the airship, and, as I was expecting you
any day, I thought it was the thing to do. Here
are the orders now,” and he pulled two pieces of
paper from his pocket.</p>

<p>“Let’s see ’em!” exclaimed Jerry eagerly.</p>

<p>Bob and Ned looked over his shoulder as the
tall lad read. Clearly enough the letters purported
to be orders on Boise for the delivery of
the <i>Comet</i>. But it needed only a glance to show
that they were forgeries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“I never signed that letter!” cried Jerry
wrathfully. “I might have known Noddy would
be up to some trick like this.”</p>

<p>“And that isn’t Mr. Glassford’s writing,
either,” added Ned. “I have a letter from him
in my pocket, explaining where he would leave
the <i>Comet</i> for us,” and he pulled out the epistle,
comparing it with the one Boise had handed over.
Though there was some similarity between the
two signatures, the boys could easily see that the
order for the airship had been forged. There
was no question as to the letter purporting to be
signed by Jerry. That signature was not a bit
like his.</p>

<p>“And yet these don’t look as if Noddy wrote
them,” spoke Jerry, as he scanned the forged
documents. “He couldn’t write as firm a hand
as this.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be surprised but what that former
college teacher did it,” suggested Professor Snodgrass.
“He has probably added forgery to his
other accomplishments. Let me take a look. I
don’t know his writing, but I can tell an educated
hand.”</p>

<p>The professor looked carefully at the two documents,
and said it was very evident that Dr. Belgrade
had written them.</p>

<p>“It is too finished a hand to have been penned
by a lad like Noddy Nixon,” declared Uriah Snodgrass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
“Probably Noddy did not feel equal to
that part of the work, and got his crony to attempt
it.”</p>

<p>“I believe you’re right,” agreed Jerry. “But
what did they do with the airship, Mr. Boise?”</p>

<p>“Took her away, and right from in front of
my face. Oh, I was a ninny to stand there and
see ’em do it!”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t your fault,” declared Jerry. “Almost
anyone would have given up the craft, after
receiving two such orders as these. But where
did they go?”</p>

<p>“That I can’t say. They seemed in very much
of a hurry, and, after I had unlocked the big
doors, and opened ’em, they wheeled the <i>Comet</i>
out, and started her up. She ran beautifully, too,
for Mr. Glassford had told me to keep her ready
for a quick flight, and I did. There was plenty
of gasolene in the tanks, and she was fit for a big
journey.”</p>

<p>“Were there three of them?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, the young fellow, who the others called
Noddy, a rough sort of a chap, and a slick-looking
man.”</p>

<p>“Bill Berry and Dr. Belgrade, all right,” commented
Ned.</p>

<p>“Did you hear them say where they were going?”
asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“No, they didn’t talk much. Just a few words.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
They seemed to know how to work the machinery,
and I never had a suspicion that anything was
wrong. I did ask ’em where they expected to
meet you boys, and Noddy said somewhere outside
of Denver.”</p>

<p>“I guess that part was the only true thing he
said,” remarked Jerry grimly. “And when we
do meet him, outside of Denver, or anywhere
else, well——”</p>

<p>He did not finish, but there was a stern look
on his face.</p>

<p>“Which way did they head, as they started
off?” asked Ned, seeking for possible clews.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t say,” replied Boise. “I watched
’em until they got high in the air, and then they
got beyond my sight. I haven’t very good eyes,
so I couldn’t say where they did head for.”</p>

<p>“Did they take any provisions along?” Bob
wanted to know, and this time his chums did not
laugh at him, for they realized the wisdom of his
question.</p>

<p>“None that I saw,” replied the watchman.
“And there were none in the airship.”</p>

<p>“Then they can’t go very far!” cried Bob.
“Fellows, we’ve got to get right after ’em.
They’ll have to come down to feed, and that will
be our chance.”</p>

<p>“But how can we get after ’em?” asked Jerry.
“On foot? Our airship is gone, and our auto is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
hundreds of miles away. How are we going to
do it?”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Bob, much downcast.</p>

<p>“An airship is what we need,” commented
Ned, “and that’s out of the question.”</p>

<p>“There were plenty here a while ago,” remarked
the watchman, “but they’ve been taken
away since the meet. Oh, I’m so sorry I let those
fellows fool me!”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t help it,” declared Jerry kindly.
“Now it’s up to us to get busy, and make Noddy
pay for the trouble he has caused us. Come on,
boys. We’ll get back to the hotel, and talk it
over. Something has got to be done.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Professor Snodgrass, “we must
get to Snake Island before they do, or they may
get the only two-tailed toad that is there.”</p>

<p>“And, naturally, they’ll get all the radium,”
spoke Ned.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, but I can’t do anything more for
you,” said Boise. “I just came out this morning,
after closing the hangar up last night, to get
a few things I’d left behind. My work here is
done, and I’m looking for a new job. If I could
help you I would.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you can’t,” replied Jerry, and,
parting from Boise, they started for the trolley
that would take them back to their hotel. They
were sad and discouraged. After all their hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
work and preparations, to be thus beaten by
Noddy and his plotters! It was the worst of bad
luck.</p>

<p>“Gentleman here to see you,” remarked the
hotel clerk when they went up to the desk to get
the keys to their adjoining rooms. “He’s in the
reading-room now, I think. Said he’d wait a little
while for you.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” asked Ned eagerly.</p>

<p>“He didn’t leave his name. Front!” he called
to one of the bell boys, “tell that gentleman with
the tall hat, in the reading-room, that the young
gentlemen he was asking for have come in now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!” exclaimed the lad whose coat was
a mass of buttons.</p>

<p>“We’ll go in the reading-room, and talk to
him,” suggested Jerry, wondering who their visitor
could be. As the three lads entered the apartment
they saw a familiar figure at the far end.</p>

<p>“Mr. Montrose!” exclaimed Ned, as he recognized
the father of little Gladys, whom they
had rescued from the wreck.</p>

<p>“Oh, boys! I’m glad to see you!” cried Mr.
Montrose. “I’ve been inquiring at half the
hotels in Denver for you. I came on with my
wife a while ago. She is much better, and as soon
as I got home with her she insisted that I look
you up. Gladys wants to see you also, and, as I
forgot in the excitement to ask what hotel you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
were going to stop at, though I heard you say
you were coming to this city, and as I mislaid
your cards, the only way I had to find you was
to describe you to the different hotel clerks. But
at last I found you. I’m so glad! I want you
to come out to my house at once.”</p>

<p>Then, as if struck by something in the lads’
faces the gentleman asked:</p>

<p>“Why, what is the matter? Has anything
happened?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there has!” exclaimed Bob impulsively.
“Our airship has been taken by Noddy Nixon,”
and then, in a few brief words the boys told of
what had happened.</p>

<p>“And so he got ahead of you, after all,” commented
Mr. Montrose, “and flew away in your
airship?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we want to chase him, for he can’t
get very far, but we haven’t anything to do it in,”
remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“We need another airship,” added Jerry.</p>

<p>“Another airship!” exclaimed Mr. Montrose.
“How big a one? Would a biplane, carrying
three, answer?”</p>

<p>“Would it?” cried Jerry. “It certainly
would! Even if we couldn’t take any provisions
along for Chunky. But where could we get one
on such short notice?”</p>

<p>“From me!” suddenly exclaimed Mr. Montrose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
“Boys, I’ve been wondering how I could
reward you for what you did for me—saving my
daughter. I knew it would have to be something
out of the ordinary. And this gives me just the
chance I want. I’ll provide you with an aeroplane,
so you can chase after Noddy Nixon!”</p>

<p>“But we need it right away!” cried Jerry.
“There isn’t time to have one made.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right. I have one that’s in
perfect order, if you can believe the man who
made it. And it has flown recently, so it ought
to go now. You can start this afternoon, I guess.
Come and sit down, and I’ll tell you all about
it,” and Mr. Montrose led the boys toward a
quiet corner of the reading-room.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>ON THE TRAIL</small></h2>


<p>“How in the world does it happen that you
have an airship, just when one is most needed?”
asked Jerry, as he and his chums seated themselves
near Mr. Montrose.</p>

<p>“I admit it does sound like a fairy story,” said
that gentleman with a smile, “but I assure you it
is all plain facts. I am not an aviator, nor am I
a dealer in airships. I’m a banker here in Denver.
The quiet life for mine. I’d no more think
of going up in an airship than I would of putting
on a diver’s outfit, and going to the bottom of the
sea. And yet I own what I am told is one of
the best biplanes made. You see, it was this
way:</p>

<p>“When we had this meet, for aeroplanes and
balloons out in Buffalo Park, there were a number
of cranks, as there always are at an affair of that
kind.</p>

<p>“Some of them came to me, with plans for
airships that I could easily see would never fly.
Others seemed to have good ideas. They all
wanted money to build their craft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“There was one young fellow who seemed to
have a plan for a good sort of airship, and I took
quite a notion to him. I got an engineer to look
over the drawings, and, on his report, I advanced
the money for the young man to build his biplane.
It was a success from the start, and he made several
preliminary flights, and won some prizes in
the meet.</p>

<p>“Then he met with an accident, and not, as
you might suppose, while up in the air. He was
coming to the park one day to give an exhibition
flight, when he was struck by a trolley car, and so
badly injured that he died in a few days. That
left me with a first-class airship on my hands, for
I took it away from the grounds, and had it stored
in my barn.</p>

<p>“That’s how it happens that I have a biplane
in good working order, and if it is of any service
to you boys, you are welcome to her. I’d do
anything for you, after what you did for me and
I hope that you can make use of this craft.”</p>

<p>“It is very kind of you to offer it to us,” spoke
Jerry, “and I think it will be just the thing we
need. Of course we don’t know anything about
the engine, or how the biplane will sail, nor how
fast. But I’m sure it will help us in our hunt for
Noddy Nixon.”</p>

<p>“Then suppose you come out to my place and
look her over,” suggested Mr. Montrose. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
have my auto out in front, and it won’t take long
to get to my house. Besides, I want you boys to
pay me a visit, anyhow. Get your baggage from
the hotel, and be my guests.”</p>

<p>The boys could not refuse. They paid
their bill at the hotel, and had their baggage
taken to Mr. Montrose’s fine big house. As
soon as the professor arrived there, he hurried
out to a fish pond, with a small net, and was not
seen again until night, when he came in with more
specimens.</p>

<p>As for the boys, their first visit was to the
barn where the airship was stored. Mr. Montrose
went with them, and he smiled in appreciation
at what the three chums said.</p>

<p>For perhaps two minutes they examined it carefully,
Jerry paying particular attention to the engine.
Then Bob burst out with:</p>

<p>“Well, it’s not so bad. I see a place where
we can fasten a box on to carry some lunch.”</p>

<p>“Trust Chunky for that,” murmured Ned.</p>

<p>“The engine is powerful,” was Jerry’s opinion,
“and the propellers are well made. She has
speed all right.”</p>

<p>“And she’ll carry the three of us,” added Ned.
“Of course we’ll have to come down after every
trip of about a hundred miles, for she doesn’t
carry gasolene for much more than that. But we
can chase Noddy in ‘century’ stretches, and gasolene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
is easy to get around here. I say, let’s take
her, and have a try.”</p>

<p>“We can stop for lunch anywhere if we happen
to run short,” proposed Bob.</p>

<p>“If you say lunch again, I’ll make you eat an
onion!” cried Jerry, knowing how Bob hated
them.</p>

<p>“Do you think it will do?” asked Mr. Montrose,
full of interest in the project of the motor
boys.</p>

<p>“Do? It’s just fine!” cried Ned. “We can’t
thank you enough.”</p>

<p>“It is I who am in your debt,” spoke the
banker. “You are welcome to the machine. I
don’t know anything about them, and you may be
taking a big risk to run it, but I hope not.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’ll run all right,” answered Jerry,
looking over the craft with a critical eye. “We’ll
give it a try-out now.”</p>

<p>The professor being engaged in capturing specimens,
the boys had the test to themselves. They
wheeled the aeroplane out in a big field, and, after
trying the engine, and finding that it worked almost
to perfection, got ready for a flight. Mr.
Montrose and his wife, who could sit up in an
easy chair, and Gladys, with her wounded doll,
watched the lads from a safe distance.</p>

<p>“Of course this isn’t like our <i>Comet</i>,” said
Jerry to his chums. “It’s just a straight aeroplane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and if the engine stops we’ve got to volplane
down. But I think she’ll enable us to get
on Noddy’s trail. We’ll go up for a short flight,
and then if she’s all right, we’ll start out, and go
as far as we can before dark.”</p>

<p>“Which way?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Toward the Grand Canyon,” answered Jerry.
“That’s where Noddy and his crew will head
for.”</p>

<p>“Get busy then!” cried Ned. “We’re on
Noddy’s trail once more!”</p>

<p>Our motor boys were too experienced hands
with all forms of airships to have much trouble
with the fine one the unfortunate young man had
perfected. It worked perfectly, and carried the
three with ease. Of course it was nothing like
the <i>Comet</i>, and could remain aloft but a comparatively
short time. But it was a great help
in an emergency.</p>

<p>The lads soared upward, circled around over
Mr. Montrose’s house, and then started straight
away. They covered several miles and returned.</p>

<p>“Now for the chase!” cried Jerry grimly, as
they made a descent.</p>

<p>“Oh, what wonderful boys!” cried Mrs. Montrose.
“You are so daring!”</p>

<p>“No danger at all,” Ned assured her.</p>

<p>It did not take them long to pack a few articles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
of clothing, a light lunch and a few other necessaries
on the aeroplane, which they named the
<i>Chaser</i>. They planned to travel as far as they
could before dark, and then stop at some hotel
or farmhouse over night. In the morning they
would renew the pursuit of Noddy. Professor
Snodgrass was to remain at the Montrose home,
seeking specimens, and the boys promised to call
back for him when they had succeeded in their
quest, or had proved to their own satisfaction
that they could not catch Noddy.</p>

<p>“But we’ll get him!” cried Ned, as he and his
companions took their places in the <i>Chaser</i>.</p>

<p>“Come back to Annabell and me!” cried
Gladys after them.</p>

<p>“We will,” promised Bob.</p>

<p>There was the clattering racket of the explosions
in the cylinders. The big propellers
whizzed around with terrific force. The biplane
trembled, and then began to roll slowly across
the smooth lawn on her bicycle wheels.</p>

<p>“Good luck!” cried Mr. Montrose.</p>

<p>His wife and daughter waved their hands to
the motor boys.</p>

<p>A moment later the stanch little machine rose
into the air, and soared away over the treetops
on the quest after the unprincipled bully who
had taken away the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>“Now we’re on his trail!” cried Bob, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
looked to see that the lunch basket was securely
fastened.</p>

<p>“I hope we catch him soon,” murmured Jerry,
as he grasped the steering-wheel with a firmer
grip, and peered ahead for a glimpse of their own
beloved craft.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>A DESPERATE RACE</small></h2>


<p>From Denver to that part of the Grand Canyon
of the Colorado in Arizona where Snake
Island might be located, the distance is about five
hundred miles. Jerry had calculated this before
starting, and he had told his chums that there
was a chance of catching Noddy before the latter
could reach the great gash in the earth that represented
the canyon.</p>

<p>“For I don’t believe Noddy is going to be
very expert in managing our <i>Comet</i>,” commented
the tall lad. “He may know how to run an ordinary
aeroplane, but when he gets mixed up with
our dirigible balloon he’ll come a cropper, sooner
or later.”</p>

<p>“Make it later,” advised Bob. “We don’t
want him smashing our airship with any croppers.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know that he’ll take a tumble,”
went on Jerry, “only he won’t know how to run
her so as to get the best speed out of her. That
means that he’ll be longer than he thinks he’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
be in getting to the canyon, and we’ll have a
chance to catch up to him, even if he has a good
start.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what he’ll do, if he does get to the
canyon?” asked Ned, as, in response to a sign
from Jerry, he adjusted the carburetor so as to
give the engine a richer mixture.</p>

<p>“Why, he’ll hover over it, the same as we
would, I suppose,” replied the tall lad, “and try
to pick out Snake Island. He doesn’t know exactly
where it is, any more than we do, but I
guess there aren’t many islands in that part of
the river, and so he won’t have much trouble
picking it out. The only thing for us to do is to
get there first.”</p>

<p>“Can we do it with this machine?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a pretty good craft,” replied Jerry,
as he turned on more power, and did various evolutions
in the air to ascertain how the <i>Chaser</i>
responded to the helm. “Of course she isn’t
as speedy as the <i>Comet</i>, but she might be, with
Noddy tinkering with our machinery, and not
getting the best out of it. We’ve got to take
our chance.”</p>

<p>The <i>Chaser</i> was indeed a fine craft of her class,
and soon the motor boys were high in the air,
sailing in an almost direct south-western direction
from Denver, to reach the Colorado.</p>

<p>For several miles they proceeded in a straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
line, at a height of about a mile, as this gave
them a good view ahead, unobstructed by any
clouds which would have hampered them had they
gone higher. But the clear air held not a speck
that might be taken for the missing <i>Comet</i>. The
boys strained their eyes in vain. They were making
good time, and the wind cut into their faces,
for there was no protection as in the comfortable
cabin of their own craft.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you might slow up a bit?”
suggested Bob after a while.</p>

<p>“Why?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“Because it’s ’most lunch time, and—er—well,
you know you can hardly breathe if you open your
mouth going at this speed, and if we try to eat
any sandwiches we may get choked. So if you
slowed up——”</p>

<p>“All right, Chunky, enough said!” cried Ned.
“Slow up, Jerry, I’m hungry too.”</p>

<p>Accordingly the <i>Chaser</i> was brought down to a
speed that just kept her afloat, and Bob opened
the lunch basket. It was no novelty for the boys
to dine while high in the air, but it was rather
more inconvenient in an open aeroplane than in
the <i>Comet</i>. Still they managed.</p>

<p>They spent the afternoon going straight on, or
circling about at times to cover a wider area, but
with all their looking, and peering through powerful
binoculars, they had no glimpse of the craft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
they sought. It was beginning to get dusk, and
Jerry suggested that they had better go down,
and seek a resting place for the night.</p>

<p>“There’s no use flying after dark,” he said,
“and we can pick out a better landing place if
we do it now, than if we wait until later.”</p>

<p>They were flying over a rather lonesome section
of the country just then, and no houses were
in sight. But, a little later, Jerry picked out a
small cabin in the midst of a clearing in the woods,
and said:</p>

<p>“I guess this will do as well as anything. It
doesn’t look very big, but we can sleep out-doors
if we have to.”</p>

<p>Jerry tilted the deflecting rudder, and the craft
gracefully swooped down toward the earth.
While yet a little distance from the ground the
boys were surprised to see a tall, lank man, followed
by a woman and several children, rush
from the cabin, and take refuge behind a pile of
wood. Then, as the airship came to a stop, after
running across the ground on the bicycle wheels,
a rifle was poked over the top of the logs, held
unwaveringly on the three lads, while a voice
drawled out:</p>

<p>“Hold on, strangers! I may not be able to
manage one of them consarned flippity-flop shebangs,
but I’m a tolerable good shot with this
gun, and she goes off on a hair trigger. So if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
you don’t want to be made into coffee strainers,
git!”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter?” asked Jerry.
“We don’t mean anything, we only want——”</p>

<p>“Ye can’t fool me!” cried the voice of the
man who held the gun. As for himself he was
hidden by the wood. “Ye can’t come none of
them games on me. Keep hid, ’Mandy, an’ don’t
let the children stick their heads up. I’ll drive
these pirates off.”</p>

<p>“What do you take us for?” asked Jerry, in
surprise.</p>

<p>“Kidnappers—that’s what! I’ve read about
ye in the papers. Kidnappers, an’ bomb throwers,
that’s what ye be. They had a exhibition over in
Denver, an’ the papers told how they dropped
bombs from them airships, an’ how they took
children up in ’em. Ye can’t do that here. I’ve
got nine, an’ I want every one. Keep hid,
’Mandy.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re mistaken,” spoke Jerry with
a laugh, which was a bit forced on account of the
gun that seemed pointed directly at him. “We
are neither bomb throwers nor kidnappers. I
don’t know how the papers could have said that
anything like that was done at the Denver exhibition.
Of course there may have been some
bomb-dropping contests, but only harmless chalk
balls were used, and, as for children, I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
heard of any being taken up in an aeroplane.”</p>

<p>“Ye know you didn’t read it yourse’f, pap,”
interposed a woman’s voice from behind the wood
pile.</p>

<p>“Well, Gabe Ralston were tellin’ me about it,
an’ I reckon he can read,” declared the man.</p>

<p>“Now don’t be silly, pap!” went on the woman.
“I’m sure them young men look harmless.”</p>

<p>“I assure you we are!” cried Jerry, and he
quickly told why they were on the wing, and how
they had happened to come down. “We’d like
shelter and a meal, and are willing to pay for it,”
he concluded.</p>

<p>At the mention of “pay,” the gun was at once
withdrawn, and, after a moment of whispered
conversation between the man and his wife, the
former came out, looking rather ashamed of his
action. He left his gun behind.</p>

<p>“Well, strangers,” he said, “I guess maybe
it’s all right. I have to be cautious, you know,
livin’ all alone as I do, with a wife an’ nine
children t’ protect. Come out, ’Mandy,” he
called, and a woman, followed by the nine youngsters,
ranging in sizes like a “pair of stairs,”
came from behind the wood pile.</p>

<p>The children, once they saw that no immediate
harm was intended, gathered about the airship, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
did the man and his wife. Soon there was a
feeling of confidence and friendship, and the woman
at once set about getting a meal. Jerry and
his chums told how the craft worked, and the
solitary farmer was much interested. He admitted
that all he knew about airships was what
Gabe Ralston had told him.</p>

<p>“An’ Gabe can’t read over’n above well,” the
man added.</p>

<p>There was hardly room for the boys to sleep in
the small cabin, and so, after a generous supper,
they were given blankets, and made their beds out
of doors. The night was a fine one, and they
slept well. Jerry’s generous payment for the accommodation
brought a storm of protest from
the man and his wife the next morning. But the
tall lad said:</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s not too much, but if you think it
is——”</p>

<p>“Have ’em put us up a lunch,” suggested Bob
in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>“Chunky suggests a lunch,” finished the tall
lad with a smile, and the woman hastened to fill
the basket.</p>

<p>For the rest of that day the motor boys circled
about, or advanced swiftly in straight lines, ever
seeking the <i>Comet</i>. But she was not in sight.</p>

<p>At noon they descended to renew their supply
of gasolene, and the night was spent in a country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
village, where they created considerable excitement
and interest.</p>

<p>It was about ten o’clock the next morning when
Bob hastily caught up the binoculars, and directed
them at a speck in the sky off to the left.</p>

<p>“See anything?” asked Jerry quickly.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure,” replied the fat lad, after an
observation, “it’s either a big bird or——”</p>

<p>He did not finish his sentence, but his hands
trembled slightly as he passed the glasses to
Jerry. Ned reached over and managed the wheel
while Jerry looked.</p>

<p>“It’s her all right!” suddenly cried the tall
lad. “Now to catch him.”</p>

<p>“Is it Noddy?” asked Ned eagerly.</p>

<p>“It’s the <i>Comet</i> all right,” was the answer,
“and I guess Noddy’s on board. Now to see
what the <i>Chaser</i> is made of!”</p>

<p>Jerry opened the motor full, and with a roar
that fairly shook the comparatively frail craft
from end to end, she shot ahead, her propellers
beating the air relentlessly.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a desperate race!” cried
Ned.</p>

<p>“And we’re going to win!” declared Jerry
grimly.</p>

<p>The race was on. Faster and faster flew the
<i>Chaser</i>, until, even without the glasses, it could
be seen that she was drawing nearer to the <i>Comet</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
A view through the binoculars showed that those
on board the stolen aircraft were rushing frantically
about, doubtless trying to develop as much
speed as possible.</p>

<p>“Can you make it, Jerry?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“We’ve <em>got</em> to!” was the quick reply.</p>

<p>It was evident that the only hope the motor
boys had of recovering their craft lay in the inability
of those on board her to get out of her all
the speed possible. With the machinery of the
<i>Comet</i> run to the best advantage, no other airship
could catch her. But Jerry counted on Noddy
and his cronies not knowing enough to do the
right thing at the right time. Then, too, the
<i>Chaser</i> was very speedy when rightly handled.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer crept the pursuing craft.
She was directly in the rear of the <i>Comet</i> now.
Suddenly Bob cried:</p>

<p>“Jerry, they’re going up!”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll go too!” was the answer. “We
can hit as high an altitude as they can.”</p>

<p>“And they’re flying as a dirigible, and not as
an aeroplane at all!” added Ned. “They’re
afraid to use the wing planes, Jerry! Maybe we
can get ahead of ’em after all!”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>A GAME IN THE AIR</small></h2>


<p>With a pull on the lever of the ascending
rudder, Jerry sent the <i>Chaser</i> shooting upward
into the air. He made the craft take a long
slant, for he had seen that the <i>Comet</i> was going
up more vertically, and Jerry figured on getting
under the stolen airship, and then, when once in
advance, turning, and so approaching head on.</p>

<p>“They’re going up fast!” commented Ned,
watching their own craft narrowly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Jerry. “They’re using all
the gas the generator can turn out. I only hope
they don’t burst the bag, or ruin the machinery.”</p>

<p>“If they do, we’ll make Noddy pay for it!”
cried Bob.</p>

<p>“That would be more bother than it would be
worth,” was Jerry’s opinion. “We’ll try to get
the machine away from him before he has a
chance to do much damage.”</p>

<p>Upward the <i>Comet</i> mounted steadily, for those
on board were evidently pushing her to the utmost.
On account of the limited facilities on the
aeroplane, Jerry and his chums could not go up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
on such a sharp slant as could their enemies, but
this suited our heroes just as well.</p>

<p>The two airships were now comparatively close
together. The <i>Comet</i> was still shooting upward,
and the <i>Chaser</i> was directly below her.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from the upper craft, came a cry of
alarm.</p>

<p>“They’ve discovered us!” was Bob’s opinion.</p>

<p>“No, they did that some time ago,” said Jerry.
“I’m afraid something has happened.”</p>

<p>“It does seem so,” agreed Ned. “Look at
that smoke!” he yelled. “She’s on fire!”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t that,” was Jerry’s retort, after a
quick glance at their craft through the glasses.
“They’ve been using too much lifting gas, and the
generator is choked. It’s escaping through the
safety valve. She won’t go any higher now, but
she can still go forward. We haven’t got ’em
yet.”</p>

<p>As if to prove his words, the <i>Comet</i>, now that
she had reached the limit of her climbing powers,
darted forward. But Jerry had made good use
of his opportunity, and he was now ahead of the
<i>Comet</i>, though still slightly below her.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do now?” asked Ned,
as he saw his chum put his foot on a pedal that
connected with the motor.</p>

<p>“I’m going to use the last notch of speed, and
see if I can stop ’em!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>With a rush the <i>Chaser</i> mounted upward and,
a few minutes later, she was on the same level
as was the <i>Comet</i>, and considerably in advance.
Both craft were moving with considerable speed,
but, owing to the fact that her gas bag was so
choked with vapor, causing a big wind resistance,
the <i>Comet</i> must necessarily move more slowly
than the <i>Chaser</i>.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do, Jerry?” asked
Ned, as he saw his chum reach for a rudder control
lever.</p>

<p>“Turn around, and come back at him head
on,” answered the tall lad. “This is going to be
a game of tag, and I’m going to make Noddy
‘it.’ To do that I’ve got to head him off. He’ll
try to dodge, I expect, but I think I can nab
him.”</p>

<p>Then began what was perhaps the most risky
and sensational game of “tag” that was ever
played—a game in the air, nearly a mile above the
earth.</p>

<p>Turning quickly to the left, <a href="#image01">Jerry sent the
<i>Chaser</i> directly at the <i>Comet</i>.</a> As he had expected,
Noddy, who was managing the craft from
the pilot house, tried to dodge to one side. He
could go no higher because the gas retort was
choked. But Jerry was ready for him, and met
the shift quickly. Once more Noddy dodged, this
time on the other side, but Jerry was right there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>The two craft were slowly coming nearer each
other, for both had reduced their forward speed.
They were like two big birds of the air, facing
each other, hovering, twisting and turning, dodging
this way and that, one seeking to escape, and
the other endeavoring to catch her antagonist.</p>

<p>First on one side and then on the other, Noddy
dodged, but every time Jerry was there facing
him. The <i>Comet</i> could not get past.</p>

<p>“He’ll have to go down soon!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s what I want him to do,” answered
Jerry grimly. “Once they are on the ground,
we can deal with ’em.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Bill and that fake doctor?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“In the motor room, probably,” answered the
steersman. “I hope they don’t do any more
damage to the machinery.”</p>

<p>The game was nearing an end now. Noddy
and his cronies were getting desperate. The
bully made one last attempt to dodge past Jerry,
but our hero was ever on the alert.</p>

<p>Head on, the two ships of the air were almost
nose and nose together. Noddy could not possibly
get past.</p>

<p>“Go down! Go down!” yelled Jerry. “Go
down before I force you, and, if I do, I won’t be
responsible for the consequences!”</p>

<p>There was no help for it. Noddy’s unpleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
face, scowling in anger, peered from the window
of the pilot house. Jerry saw him pull the
lever of the deflecting rudder, for the bully had
sneaked around the shop of the motor boys often
enough to learn the rudiments of running the
<i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>Down and down she went, fairly forced by
the <i>Chaser</i> above her, by the <i>Chaser</i>, that frail
little craft of the air, compared to which the
<i>Comet</i> was like a battleship opposed to a torpedo
destroyer. But those on the little ship
knew their business, and, after all, brains and
skill told.</p>

<p>“Can he get by?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so,” answered Jerry, watching
every move of his rival. But Noddy had
given up the fight. He was beaten at his own
game.</p>

<p>Still downward he forced the <i>Comet</i>, while
Jerry and his chums prepared to alight the moment
their craft touched the earth, to drive away
their enemies.</p>

<p>Bounding lightly, the <i>Comet</i> landed on the
ground. A moment later the aeroplane followed,
and Jerry let her run along on the bicycle wheels,
the propellers urging her on, until she was almost
in contact with the big craft. Then the tall lad
yanked on the brake lever, and the <i>Chaser</i> came
to a stop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Jerry, leaping out of his
seat. Bob and Ned followed.</p>

<p>Noddy Nixon lost no time in leaving the pilot
house on the run, and from the motor room
emerged Bill Berry and the college man. They
leaped over the rail, and joined Noddy in flight.</p>

<p>“If we ever catch ’em!” panted fat Bob, as
he ran as fast as he could. “We’ll—make—’em—pay—for—this!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>OFF FOR THE CANYON</small></h2>


<p>Jerry, who was in the lead of the chase after
Noddy and his cronies, came to a sudden resolve.
What was the use of capturing the bully, when
the recovered airship might need attention?
Clearly it would be more profitable to look after
their craft, and let Noddy escape, for the time
being. So Jerry shouted:</p>

<p>“Hey, fellows, never mind. Let ’em get
away. We’ll only have a fight on our hands,
and it isn’t worth while. Let’s see how much
damage they’ve done.”</p>

<p>“But, don’t we want to catch ’em?” demanded
Bob, who, though much out of breath, had managed
to catch up to Jerry and Ned.</p>

<p>“No; what’s the use?” asked the tall lad.</p>

<p>“But look what he did to our airship!”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I want to find out—what
he did do to the <i>Comet</i>. That’s why I say don’t
let’s chase after ’em any longer. It will only
mean more trouble, and we’ve had enough.
Come on back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly, the three chums ceased running,
and turned back toward the two airships. Noddy,
with a backward glance, had ascertained that
Jerry and his two friends were no longer in pursuit,
and so the bully slackened his pace. His
companions did likewise and, a sorry-looking trio
indeed, they made their way across the plain
above which the air game had taken place.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to catch Noddy?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“No; what’s the use?” inquired Jerry. “He’s
done all the harm he can. The thing for us to
do is to remedy it. We must see to our own
airship, and then get back, pick up the professor,
and head for Snake Island.”</p>

<p>“But what will we do with Mr. Montrose’s
aeroplane?” Bob wanted to know. “We don’t
want it to keep.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to take that back to Denver with
us. We can easily do it, as the side planes are
detachable. Let’s get busy at that, and we may
be in Denver to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“And then for the Grand Canyon of the Colorado,
and Snake Island!” added Ned.</p>

<p>Giving a last glance to Noddy and his cronies,
who were still fleeing across the plain, our heroes
made their way to the <i>Comet</i>. Aboard they
found a scene of confusion, but no serious damage
had been done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>True, a number of the machines were out of
order, and the gas generator was badly clogged,
but these were defects easily repaired. In
general the stolen airship was in almost as
good condition as when the conspirators had
taken her.</p>

<p>Beyond securing a few articles of clothing and
personal effects, Noddy and his cronies had
brought away nothing from the airship. It looked
as if they had boarded her hurriedly with very little
preparation, and had rushed away, without
even enough provisions for a long trip. They
must have stopped somewhere to get food, for
some was found on board.</p>

<p>It did not take the motor boys long to decide
what to do. They soon ascertained that the
<i>Comet</i> was in comparatively good running order.
The clogged gas machine was fixed, and then,
having enough food in the lunch basket, together
with what they found on their own craft, to last
them a day, they decided to sleep on board, even
though they were in a lonely place, and start back
for Denver in the morning.</p>

<p>As for what became of Noddy and his cronies,
they neither knew nor cared. The bully and his
conspirators had disappeared, and were doubtless
seeking shelter for the night.</p>

<p>“We caught them just in time,” remarked
Jerry, as they sat in the cabin of the <i>Comet</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
“A hundred miles more and they would have
been over the canyon of the Colorado. Then
they might have reached Snake Island, and it
would have been all up with our chances.”</p>

<p>“But now we’ll get ahead of him,” declared
Bob.</p>

<p>“If Noddy doesn’t do something else,” spoke
Jerry.</p>

<p>They spent the rest of the afternoon in taking
apart the <i>Chaser</i> for transportation back to Denver
aboard the <i>Comet</i>. Then they went to bed,
tired out from the day’s chase.</p>

<p>By pushing the <i>Comet</i> to her limit, and by making
an early start, our friends were able to reach
Denver the next night. Mr. Montrose was exceedingly
glad to see them, and he and his wife
and little girl listened with interest to the account
of the adventures of the motor boys in the
chase after Noddy.</p>

<p>As for Professor Snodgrass, he was so busy
classifying and making notes of the specimens he
had caught, that it is doubtful if he heard much
of what Jerry and his chums said.</p>

<p>“And what are you going to do next?” asked
Mr. Montrose, as the boys finished telling him
they had brought his aeroplane back on their own
craft.</p>

<p>“Start for the Grand Canyon as soon as we
can,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“But if this Nixon young man takes after you
again?” inquired Mrs. Montrose.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to do the best we can,” answered
Jerry. “But I think it will be some time before
he catches up to us this time. It was a very
lonely spot where we left him.”</p>

<p>“And the walking wasn’t very good,” added
Ned with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Still, after what he had done in the past, I
would be on the watch,” advised Mr. Montrose.</p>

<p>“Oh, we will be,” declared Jerry; and then,
after a good night’s rest, they put in the next
few days getting ready for their trip to the canyon.</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> was thoroughly overhauled, and
some needed repairs made. Though Noddy and
his companions had not been careful in their treatment
of the craft, still they had done no serious
damage.</p>

<p>“Well, I think we are ready to start for the
canyon to-day,” remarked Jerry one morning,
after about a week spent at the Montrose home.
“We can make it in two days, though it may
take us a little longer to pick out Snake Island,
and have the conditions favorable for a descent
into the big gorge.”</p>

<p>“Then you are really going down into it?”
asked Mr. Montrose. “You know it is quite
a fearsome place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“From all accounts it must be,” admitted Jerry.</p>

<p>“Think of it!” exclaimed Mr. Montrose. “I
have seen it many times, but no one can ever describe
it. A great trough or cut in the earth,
over a mile deep, twenty miles wide, and many
hundreds of miles long, winding in and out, and,
at the bottom a river rushing along resistlessly,
with waterfalls, rapids, calm stretches and vast
depths of black, silently moving water. And the
walls of that canyon! All the colors of the rainbow
cannot compare with them. They are wonderful!
Down in it are mountains, great in themselves,
but which look small in that vast gorge.
There is the glow of the Alps, the cold fogs of the
Rockies, there are purple shadows, shifting lights,
snowstorms and rainstorms. It is a place of terrific
grandeur.”</p>

<p>“And we are going there,” said Jerry quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes, to an unknown island,” went on Mr.
Montrose. “On what may be a fruitless quest.
Oh, boys, think twice before you go!”</p>

<p>“We have thought,” went on Jerry. “We
are going. We will start in the morning for the
Grand Canyon of the Colorado,” he added.</p>

<p>“And all for a bit of radium—a fortune
though it may be,” proceeded Mr. Montrose.</p>

<p>“No, not alone for the radium,” said Jerry
solemnly. “I have not spoken of this before, as
it seemed such a slim chance. But there may be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
on that island, the missing scientist, whose body
was never recovered. He may be there—in need—starving.
We are going to try to rescue him,
as much as to find the radium.”</p>

<p>“Jerry!” cried Ned. “You never hinted at
this.”</p>

<p>“No, because I did not want to raise false
hopes. But, now that we are at the last stage
of the journey, I must speak of it. I hope we
can rescue that unfortunate man. For the mere
treasure I would not risk so much. But a life is
at stake!”</p>

<p>“Then go,” said Mr. Montrose softly. “I
would be the last one to hold you back. And,
boys, from what I have seen of you, I believe you
will succeed. I wish you all success! But, do
not be deceived. You have a hard task ahead of
you. The Grand Canyon does not like to be
conquered.”</p>

<p>“We have the <i>Comet</i>,” replied the tall lad, as
if that was much, as, truly, it was.</p>

<p>“Well, we will always be thinking of you,”
said Mrs. Montrose, solemnly.</p>

<p>“And I want you to come back,” added little
Gladys. “I may have a new doll by then.”</p>

<p>“We will come back,” said Jerry, and his voice
had a new tone in it.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, having said good-bye
to their good friends, the motor boys and Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Snodgrass set off in the airship for the
Grand Canyon.</p>

<p>As they waved their hands in farewell many
thoughts came to them. Would they find Snake
Island? Would they be able to discover the
radium fortune? And, more than this, would
they be able to find and rescue Mr. Hartley Bentwell,
the daring scientist who had been missing
for nearly a year? Was he, by any chance, on
Snake Island?</p>

<p>“If he is, we’ll get him,” said Jerry grimly,
as he pointed the nose of the <i>Comet</i> toward the
clouds.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>OVER THE GREAT CHASM</small></h2>


<p>There was no particularly difficult task in
reaching the Grand Canyon from Denver. In
fact the boys could have walked all the distance
in time, or they could have gone by train, or in
an auto. But their troubles, as they well knew,
would not begin at the start. It was after they
had reached the canyon itself—that awful gash
in the earth’s surface—that they would have a
problem to solve. And that problem was how
successfully to descend into the gorge, and land
on the island.</p>

<p>“And the first thing to do is to find Snake
Island,” said Jerry, as they settled themselves
comfortably in the airship cabin, after their start.</p>

<p>“Why, all we have to do is to sail along down
in the canyon, and pick it out,” suggested Bob.
“The canyon is miles wide—twenty in some
places—so there will be room enough for us to
get around.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Ned, who, with the others had
been reading up some facts about the canyon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
“But it isn’t always clear in the canyon. There
are sudden storms, snow or rain, there are fogs—and
you know you can’t see anything in a fog,
even if you have an airship.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, fogs don’t last forever,” declared
Bob. “We’ll just have to keep on the lookout
until we sight the island. Then we can lower
ourselves, make a landing, get the radium, and
come away, and——”</p>

<p>“You forget about the missing scientist,” suggested
Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s so. Do you really think he’s there,
Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s hard to say. There’s just a chance
that he landed on the island when the others were
wrecked in their boat, and he may be there yet.
It’s a chance worth taking. I understand that a
lot of provisions were lost out of the boat, and
they may have caught on the island, as they
floated down. Then, too, there must be fish in
the river at certain seasons of the year, and there
may be birds, or some kind of animals on the
island that would do for food.”</p>

<p>“It would be a sort of Robinson Crusoe way of
living, but it might be possible. Of course it
must be horribly lonely there, for one man alone
on Snake Island,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“With all the snakes,” put in Bob.</p>

<p>“We don’t know that any snakes are there,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
remarked Jerry. “That may be just a name.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” exclaimed Ned with a shiver.
“I don’t much care for snakes.”</p>

<p>“Well, we won’t have much to do until we
get to the canyon,” declared Jerry. “We can
take it easy, and get in trim for the hard work
ahead of us. I think we won’t make any night
journeys. We’ll just land and rest. We’re in
no special rush——”</p>

<p>“Unless Noddy Nixon takes a notion to make
another trial, Jerry,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t believe he will. He’s practically
stranded. How’s he going to get an airship, and
land on the island?”</p>

<p>“He might go by boat,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s out of the question. No boat could
live in the rapids. That’s how Mr. Bentwell
came to be wrecked—he and his friends tried a
boat.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t fear Noddy?”</p>

<p>“Not much.”</p>

<p>The trip that day was without incident, and at
night they came to earth in a quiet spot where
they remained until morning. They made an
early start, and thoroughly enjoyed the fine, dry,
crisp air through which they sailed. They passed
from Colorado into Utah, and the next night
they were within easy traveling distance of the
Colorado River.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day they sailed over the great sterile
valley, or desert, and in the afternoon they had
completed the first stage of their journey, and
were at the head of the Colorado, where it was
formed by the conjunction of the Green and
Grand rivers.</p>

<p>“From now on, we’ve got our work cut out
for us,” announced Jerry, as they came to rest
that evening, not far from the great river.
“We’ll follow it, and as soon as we get anywhere
near Grand View, we’ll begin making inquiries
about Snake Island.”</p>

<p>“But I thought the island was between Grand
View and Bright Angel Trail,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“So it may be,” assented Jerry, “but I’m not
going to take any chances. It may be either one
side or the other of those places, and, if we inquire
as we go along, we won’t be so far out.
It won’t take us long, and it is better to be sure
than sorry.”</p>

<p>“All right, we’re with you,” assented Ned;
and Bob nodded his head to show that he agreed.</p>

<p>Their trip over the Colorado, hovering in the
air about half a mile above the river, was devoid
of incident for the first two hundred miles. They
made that in one day, and camped the first night
just over the border of Arizona. From there
the Grand Canyon proper starts, though it is of
comparative little grandeur until the Little Colorado,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
a salty stream, joins the main body of water.</p>

<p>It was about noon, the next day, that the boys
really got over the great canyon. They had
been sailing along, talking of the prospect before
them, and Professor Snodgrass had been
classifying some of the specimens he had caught
while at Mr. Montrose’s house, when the aspect
of things suddenly changed.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it’s about time we ate?”
asked Bob, with a look at his watch, as he started
for the galley.</p>

<p>Jerry happened to look down through the
plate glass window in the floor of the main cabin,
where they were all gathered, for the <i>Comet</i> was
being steered automatically.</p>

<p>“Eat!” cried the tall lad. “Eat! Look
down there, and then say ‘eat’ again if you
dare!”</p>

<p>Ned, Bob and the professor looked. Below
them they saw a great gash in the earth—a gash
a mile or more in depth, and the sides of which
were of black rock, mingled here and there with
marble colored red, pink and blue, with an occasional
bright yellow. Then came sandstone
rocks, vivid in color. It was like looking into a
great winding trough, wherein a painter had
mixed his colors.</p>

<p>And, at the very bottom, like a silver thread,
ran the river, zig-zagging in and out amid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
mighty cliffs that towered on either side. Cliffs
now hemming in the powerful stream, and again
spreading out for ten or twenty miles. But the
river itself was kept in narrow bounds.</p>

<p>And the very narrowness of these bounds made
the stream rush along with such tremendous
power, for it was a veritable Niagara in places.
White and foam-capped, again black and deep,
with awful power it hurled itself along.</p>

<p>Above this scene of awful grandeur hovered
the airship, and, as the boys looked, they saw how
slight indeed was the power of their craft, compared
to the mighty forces that had cut this gash
in the earth, and which power still sent the river
on its downward way.</p>

<p>“And we’ve got to go down there?” asked
Bob softly.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” answered Jerry. “Do you wonder
no boat ever lived to make the passage? Or,
at best, very few of them?”</p>

<p>“And that is where the scientist was lost,”
murmured Uriah Snodgrass. “I wonder if we
shall ever find him—alive—or dead?”</p>

<p>And, as the boys gazed at the foaming river,
down in the awful depths, it seemed impossible
that human beings could ever have navigated it.
But in the airship the problem was much easier.</p>

<p>“Now for Snake Island!” cried Jerry, as,
having stopped the <i>Comet</i> in order that all might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
get a good view, he started the motor again.
“Now for Snake Island!”</p>

<p>“And the radium!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“And my two-tailed toad,” added the professor.</p>

<p>“And, perhaps, the poor scientist,” spoke Bob
softly. “I—I hope he hasn’t starved to death.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>THE BOAT IN THE RAPIDS</small></h2>


<p>“Well, boys, we’re here at last,” remarked
Jerry, after a while, when they had traversed
some length of the canyon in the airship. “We’re
here after a lot of hard work, and the next question
is, what are we going to do; now that we are
on the ground?”</p>

<p>“Go to Snake Island at once,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“Eat,” advised Bob, who had started to get
a meal, but who had come back to the cabin, to
wait while some of the things cooked.</p>

<p>“Chunky’s infallible recipe whenever anything
goes wrong,” commented Jerry. “Still it
wouldn’t be a bad idea. We can talk it over
while we’re eating, and decide what’s best to be
done.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with going at once to the
island?” asked Ned. “I thought that was what
we came here for.”</p>

<p>“It is, but I think it will be a good plan to
see if we can learn anything about it before we
go too far down the river. It may be that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
is no such place as Snake Island. Or, it may be
that, even in our airship, it is impossible to get
to it. We want to find out all about it before we
go too far.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s your idea?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I think we ought to——”</p>

<p>“Dinner’s ready,” interrupted Bob, and they
went out to the table, the professor carrying with
him a book, carefully marking the place where he
had been reading by putting his finger between
the pages. The airship was moving at slow
speed, and had been set to steer herself automatically.
So the boys had nothing to interrupt
their talk of the best plan to follow.</p>

<p>Eventually they decided to travel on until they
reached Grand View, the point where Berry Trail
led down into the canyon to the banks of the rushing
river. They would make their inquiries
there, regarding the possible existence of Snake
Island.</p>

<p>It was night when they reached Grand View,
and, in order that they might be among other
tourists, who had come to visit the canyon, the
boys and the professor put up at a hotel almost
on the verge of the great chasm, storing the airship
in a big open shed, sometimes used for autos.</p>

<p>“Snake Island!” exclaimed the clerk, when
Jerry asked him about it. “Never heard of the
place. Don’t believe there’s an island in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
whole stretch of the river. But there are
some guides around here. You might ask
them.”</p>

<p>Which Jerry and his chums did, but with little
satisfaction, for it developed that few of the
guides had been farther than the regularly traveled
routes taken by tourists, and this had not
brought them to the more inaccessible parts of
the mighty river.</p>

<p>“Snake Island?” repeated one grizzled guide,
when Jerry had put the question to him. “If
anybody knows whether or not there is such a
place, it’s old Hance Stamford. Hance give up
guidin’ long ago, but in his prime there wasn’t a
better one at it. He’s gone in places no one else
dared, and if there’s a Snake Island he’ll know
about it.”</p>

<p>The boys sought out Hance the next day. He
lived in a little cabin, not far from the hotel,
being cared for by his son, who was employed as
a waiter. Hance was indeed old, being past
eighty. Yet his dull eyes opened quickly when
Jerry put to him the question that meant so much
to the motor boys.</p>

<p>“Snake Island!” exclaimed old Hance. “It’s
been many years since I heard that name. Many,
many years.”</p>

<p>“But is there any such place?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Is there? Bless you, I don’t know, son.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
I’ll tell you as much as I can, however. It must
have been forty years ago, and there weren’t
many tourists in them days. Mostly Indians. I
was making my way along the canyon with an
Indian, for in them days I had a notion I’d like
to discover things. Well, as you know, the canyon
is narrow and steep in places, and when it
rains you want to make tracks, for the river sometimes
rises thirty feet in a short time. If you’re
caught where you can’t climb up, well—it’s good-bye
for yours.</p>

<p>“A thunderstorm came up while the Indian
and I were in a narrow part of the canyon, where
the river rushed along between black walls like a
mill stream down the flume. We knew we’d have
to make tracks out of there, and we did. But
the rain came faster than we’d calculated on, and
we had to climb. Then came a fog that nearly
did for us. We managed to get some distance
down the stream, and then climbed up the steep
sides of the chasm until we came to a niche in
the wall. There we stayed until the river went
down, and we were there a day and a night, with
nothing to eat.”</p>

<p>“But about the Snake Island?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“The island. Oh yes. Well, when we were
hiding there in the hole in the wall, there came a
rift in the fog. I happened to be looking down
stream, and I saw something big and black rearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
up, right from the river it seemed. I poked
the Indian in the ribs—he was half asleep, you
know—Indians’ll sleep anywhere if they think
they’ve got to—anyhow I poked him, and he
grunted and woke up. I pointed to the tall,
black, wiggling thing, and the Indian said: ‘Snake
Island.’</p>

<p>“‘Snake!’ I yelled. ‘Who ever see a snake
as big as that?’ Then he grunted some more,
and went on to say that there was a sort of stone
island in the middle of the river. It had been
pretty well worn away except a big hill and a tall
thing, like a tower, that stuck up in the middle,
like a church steeple. It was this tall tower of
black rock that seemed like a snake. Of course
the fog made it indistinct, and the motion of the
mist made it appear as if it was wiggling about.
So that’s all I know about Snake Island. I never
went there, and I never heard of anyone getting
on it.”</p>

<p>“There was a party of college men——” began
Uriah Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I heard about <em>them</em>. But they never
got there, and one of their number was lost. I
tell you Snake Island is in a bad part of the
river.”</p>

<p>“But just where is it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“As near as I can tell, between here and Bright
Angel Trail,” replied the old guide, as he nodded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
in slumber again. “I wouldn’t go there, if I
were you.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re going,” said Jerry softly, as he
bade the old man good-bye.</p>

<p>Saying nothing to anyone in the hotel about
their plans, the boys made an early start the next
morning, and were soon gliding down over the
great chasm in their airship.</p>

<p>Below them rushed and foamed the great river—below
in its chasm trough, with walls of vari-hued
marble, of sandstone that rivaled the rainbow
in tints, while in other places, near the water
itself, were black rocks, of flinty hardness.</p>

<p>“And to think that it’s seven thousand feet
from the top of that gulf to the water,” spoke
Bob in awed tones. “I wouldn’t want to fall.”</p>

<p>As they went on they could see fogs and mists
arising, while, as the sun rose higher and higher,
it made a scene of indescribable beauty, the tints
on the walls of the canyon changing every moment.</p>

<p>It was about noon, and Jerry had calculated
that they had made about half the distance from
Grand View, when Ned, who was looking at the
rushing, foaming river below them, as it dashed
along over a gorge filled with rapids, cried out:</p>

<p>“Jerry, do you see anything down there?”</p>

<p>The tall lad looked through the plate glass window
in the bottom of the airship. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
snatched up the binoculars and focused them.</p>

<p>“It’s a boat!” he cried. “A boat in those
awful rapids! They’ve lost control of her, and
she’ll be dashed to pieces!”</p>

<p>“Anyone in it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>Once more Jerry looked carefully.</p>

<p>“Three persons!” he exclaimed. “Well, it’s
all up with them. That boat can never make the
passage.”</p>

<p>And, as he spoke, the frail craft was lost to
view as a curtain of mist rolled down and hid the
rushing river from sight.</p>

<small>STRANGE GHOSTS</small></h2>


<p>“Did you see that!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“They’re drowned!” gasped Ned.</p>

<p>“What was it, an accident?” asked Professor
Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“It would be hard to say,” remarked Jerry.
“Certainly the boat looked as if it was going
to overturn in the rapids, but I can’t really say
that it did. The fog rolled up just then and hid
everything from sight. I hope those in the boat
weren’t lost, but their chances were slim.”</p>

<p>“Can we do anything for them?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Nothing, I’m afraid,” answered the tall lad.
“We can’t even see them, and it would be useless
to descend into that canyon of fog now. Besides,
the current is so swift that the boat must
be a good way from here by this time.”</p>

<p>The airship was slowly floating along over the
Grand Canyon, which, at this point, wound in
and out among the many colored cliffs, like some
great serpent. Jerry had shut down the machinery
until it was barely turning the propellers, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
had not the gas bag sustained the craft, she would
have settled down, for the motion was not enough
to keep her afloat as an aeroplane.</p>

<p>“Well, what are we going to do?” Ned wanted
to know. “We must be nearly at Snake Island,
if there is any such place, and if we’re going to
get that radium fortune it’s time we got busy.”</p>

<p>“And I haven’t seen anything of that two-tailed
toad, either,” spoke Professor Snodgrass.
“I had hopes of finding a specimen—even if a
small one—before now, but fate seems against
me.”</p>

<p>“Wait until we get on the island,” suggested
Bob. “There may be toads there, as well as
snakes.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think there are snakes
there?” asked Ned. “Didn’t the old guide say
he thought it got its name because the tall cliff
in the middle seemed to wiggle like a serpent
when there was a fog?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he did, and if we put on a little more
steam, Jerry, we may get to Snake Island now,
in time to see that same thing. I say let’s move
faster,” went on the stout lad. “We ought to
be nearly there.”</p>

<p>“But we might pass right over the island in
this fog,” objected Jerry. “It’s better to go a
bit slow, I think.”</p>

<p>However, the problem was soon solved for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
them, as, when they had proceeded a little farther
the mist lifted and they had a clear view of
the stream as it foamed along below.</p>

<p>“But I don’t see anything of the boat, and
the three men who were in it,” observed Bob,
peering downward through the window in the
cabin floor.</p>

<p>“No. Either by this time they have been
carried many miles down the river, or they are—drowned,”
spoke Jerry softly.</p>

<p>“Well, then let’s keep a lookout for Snake
Island,” suggested Ned, and, knowing that they
must be within a comparatively short distance of
the place, if it was there at all, they all watched
eagerly, even Professor Snodgrass laying aside
his note-books.</p>

<p>Bob served dinner and the watch was resumed.
It was about two o’clock when the stout lad, who
had just finished getting the galley in order,
looked over the port rail on the bow of the air
craft. No sooner had he glimpsed the river below
him than he called out:</p>

<p>“Here we are, fellows! There she is! We’re
here at last! Now for the radium! There’s
Snake Island. We’re right over it!”</p>

<p>“Say, you’re as bad as Andy Rush!” cried
Jerry as he hurried out of the pilot house, to
join his chum.</p>

<p>“Well, if it’s true, we’ll forgive him for making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
such a fuss,” suggested Ned. “But say, I
believe he’s right, after all!”</p>

<p>“And if it is the island, oh! how I hope my
two-tailed toad may be there!” cried the professor.</p>

<p>There could be little doubt but that they were
looking at Snake island. Down below them, in
a comparatively calm stretch of the river, was a
long and rather narrow strip of land, low on the
edges, and rising abruptly in the middle. There
was a big mound, like a great hill, covered with
trees and bushes, and, in the center of this was the
tall, curiously shaped tower of rock about which
the guide had spoken.</p>

<p>“That’s Snake Island all right,” agreed Jerry,
“though I can’t say that the rocky tower in the
center looks much like a serpent.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it does from some other view,” suggested
Ned. “Then, too, there is no mist now.
I’d rather believe the place got its name from
that, than because there were snakes there.
Well, are we going down, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. I was just looking for a good
place to make a landing. Let’s drop down to
the lower end, and we can take our choice.”</p>

<p>As they sailed slowly down the length of the
curious island they noted that it was about four
miles long, and about half a mile in width. The
river here was quite broad, contrary to the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
character of the Colorado, and a glimpse over the
surrounding territory showed it to be so wild and
desolate that it is doubtful if it had ever been
visited by a white man.</p>

<p>The cliffs, too, at either side of the stream,
where the island divided it, were so high, so
rugged and precipitous, that it was positive that
no one had ever descended them. And, had even
the most daring explorer managed to get down,
he never could have gotten up without a balloon.
For that reason it was plain why the existence
of the island was practically unknown.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see but what the upper end of
the place is the best to land on,” remarked Ned,
after a circuit had been made.</p>

<p>“Guess you’re right,” agreed Jerry. “We’ll
go down there.”</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> was sent about, and, a little later,
she began settling slowly down in the great chasm,
at the bottom of which flowed the river.</p>

<p>It was getting well on in the afternoon, and the
sun, sinking in the west, no longer cast its beams
into the great gulf. There was a twilight darkness
hovering over it, a stillness broken only by
the murmur of the foaming river, that cast a
spell of gloominess over our friends. For a
time no one spoke, and then, as the airship was
about to settle down on a smooth strip of sand,
near the upper end of the river, Jerry exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, what’s the matter with us all, anyhow?
Anyone would think this was a funeral. Wake
up, you fellows!”</p>

<p>“All right! Wow! Let’s be jolly!” cried
Ned in a loud voice.</p>

<p>There was a sound like thunder, and then, from
that vast gorge came a mighty voice, repeating in
solemn tones:</p>

<p>“Let’s be jolly!”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul!” gasped Mr. Snodgrass.
“It’s an echo.”</p>

<p>“Echo!” came back in a voice like a bull’s
bellow.</p>

<p>After that they spoke in whispers, but even
then their words were flung back at them from
the sides of the cliffs in murmurs and trills that
produced an uncanny feeling.</p>

<p>“This sure is a strange place,” remarked Jerry,
as he brought the airship to a stop.</p>

<p>“Strange place!” howled the echo. Jerry
had spoken louder than he thought. He laughed,
and a giant’s chuckle was tossed back to him.
The boys looked at each other, startled, until
Bob said:</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t let’s mind this. It’s only an echo.
Let’s get busy, have a supper and to-morrow we’ll
get the radium.”</p>

<p>“Radium,” mocked the echo, but now they
were beginning to get used to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, it looks as if there was a tide in this
river,” remarked Ned, as he noted a sort of
high-water mark, where sticks and driftwood
were piled up on shore.</p>

<p>“No, that shows where the river rises when
there’s a flood, or too much rain,” explained the
professor. “The Colorado rises rapidly at
times, because the cliffs are so steep that the
water from the clouds is almost instantly all
poured into the stream. We had better get the
ship above flood mark, Jerry, as there may be
rain in the night, and we don’t want to go floating
down.”</p>

<p>Accordingly the <i>Comet</i> was wheeled farther
from shore. Night came on early, in the depths
of that gloomy chasm, for they were over a mile
below the upper rim of the steep cliffs. But when
the big gas lamps had been set aglow, making the
circle about the airship one of radiance, and when
they were gathered in the cozy cabin, they were
all more cheerful.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll start on a radium hunt the first
thing in the morning,” suggested Jerry. And,
being inside now, the echo was not so noticeable.</p>

<p>“And I will seek the two-tailed toad,” said
the professor. “I wonder if I could not have a
look now? Toads come out at night, and if I
take a light I may succeed in finding one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Supplying himself with an electric torch, the
scientist let himself out of the airship. The boys
heard him walking about outside, and then they
began talking of their trip so far, and speculating
as to how it would end.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the midst of the discussion, there
came a cry from outside.</p>

<p>“Hark!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“It’s the Professor,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s found his toad, and it’s bitten
him,” was Ned’s contribution.</p>

<p>“Boys! Boys, come here!” called the professor,
and the three lads rushed from the cabin.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Jerry. “Where are
you?”</p>

<p>“In front of the ship,” came the answer. Then
they saw the gleam of his light, and hurried toward
him.</p>

<p>“Look!” exclaimed the scientist in a whisper,
and, as he pointed toward the middle of the
island, whence arose that curious pinnacle of
rock, the three chums saw several tall and ghostly
shapes swirling slowly at them. Curious shapes
they were, like tall beings wrapped in trailing
clothes, with their long, thin arms raised as if
in warning, and about them seemed to cling, like
an enveloping haze, a weird, purplish light. The
strange shapes seemed blown onward by the night
wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“What—what are they?” gasped Bob in a
whisper.</p>

<p>“Ghosts, I guess,” answered Jerry, with a
half-hearted laugh. “The ghosts of Snake Island.”</p>

<p>“Ghosts of Snake Island,” came back the echo.
And then, as suddenly as they had appeared, the
“ghosts” vanished, leaving the boys and the professor
staring into the darkness.</p>

<small>A NEST OF SERPENTS</small></h2>


<p>“What—what do you think they were?”
asked Bob, after a few moments of silence. He
spoke in low tones, so that the weird echo would
not repeat his words.</p>

<p>“I give it up,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Maybe they were the ghosts of the three
men in the boat, who may have been drowned
around here,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed the tall lad. “Don’t
be silly, Ned.”</p>

<p>“Well, I was only joking.”</p>

<p>“Pretty poor joking,” commented Bob. “I’m
going inside. It’s chilly out here,” and he shivered.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess it is more pleasant inside,”
agreed Jerry. “Did you see anything of your
toad, Professor?”</p>

<p>“No, not a thing, but I got several other valuable
specimens, so my evening was not wasted.
I guess I’ll go in with you.”</p>

<p>“What do you think those queer shapes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
were?” asked Jerry of the scientist, when they
were once more in the cabin.</p>

<p>“Well, it would be hard to say,” spoke Professor
Snodgrass. “Of course none of us believe
in ghosts, and yet there are queer manifestations,
sometimes, that even science cannot satisfactorily
explain. My honest belief is that this
was some effect of the fog, or night vapors arising
out of the damp ground.”</p>

<p>“But they looked—er—just like men wrapped
in sheets,” spoke Bob with a shudder.</p>

<p>“Yes, I dare say they did. And, if you tried
hard enough you could imagine almost anything.
Probably it will be easy to explain. To-morrow
we will look at the place whence they seemed to
arise from the ground. It may be that there is
a hot spring there, and that the ‘ghosts’ were
only wisps of steam vapor.”</p>

<p>With this explanation the boys contented themselves,
and they were soon in bed. Nor did they
sleep any the less soundly because of the queer
manifestation. For they were sensible and
healthy lads, and it took more than a so-called
“ghost” to disturb their rest.</p>

<p>In the morning, accompanied by the professor,
they made a careful examination of the place
where the queer wraiths had been seen, but it afforded
them no clew. The ground seemed no
different from that in other spots on the island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, there’s no use bothering over that any
longer,” suggested Jerry, after a bit. “We can
try and solve that problem later; maybe to-night.
What I think we’d better do now is to explore
the island, and see if we can find any of that
radium. What do you think, Professor?”</p>

<p>“I agree with you, and yet I am in two minds
about it. You see, boys, while I want to help
you find the treasure, which may or may not be
here, it is very important that I look for that rare
toad. Now what I am going to propose is this:</p>

<p>“You go off by yourselves, and hunt for the
radium. I’ll tell you in what sort of rock it is
likely to be found, and you can collect specimens,
and bring them back with you. At night I’ll test
them. But you must mark, in some way, the exact
location of each bit of rock specimen you
take. Then, in case there are evidences of radium,
we can find the spot again.</p>

<p>“In the meanwhile I’ll be looking for the toad.
I can soon tell if there are any on the island, and
if I find there are none, or no traces of any, I’ll
join you in the hunt for the radium treasure. Or,
in case I do get what I am looking for, I will be
satisfied, and in that case I will also join you.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good plan,” agreed Jerry. “Come
on, Bob and Ned, and we’ll look for the radium,
while the Professor is toad-hunting.”</p>

<p>Uriah Snodgrass had already told the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
much about radium, and the various forms in
which it might be found. He only reminded them,
now, of the main points to be remembered, and
the three chums set off.</p>

<p>With eager eyes Jerry, Ned and Bob scanned
the various kinds of rocks as they passed along,
making their way toward the lower end of the
island. As they advanced the land gradually
rose until they were quite a height above the river
that flowed on either side of them. Across the
stream could be seen the mighty cliffs; black near
the water, and of various colors as the top was
approached. There was the glow of the sun
overhead, but, only in the middle of the day, did
the beams penetrate to the bottom of the titanic
canyon.</p>

<p>Specimen after specimen of rock was picked up
and cast aside, as none of them showed the characteristics
of radium. Noon came, and the quest
was unsuccessful. They ate their lunch on a
shelf of rock, looking down into the wonderful
river that had carved out such a channel for
itself. Most of the afternoon was spent as fruitlessly,
until finally Bob remarked:</p>

<p>“Fellows, don’t you think we’d better get
back? It’s getting dark all of a sudden.”</p>

<p>“I think we’re in for a storm,” spoke Jerry,
with a glance toward the clouds that hovered over
the chasm. “And it looks as if it would be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
bad one. The river is sure to rise, and I’m not
altogether satisfied with the place where we left
the <i>Comet</i>. She ought to be anchored higher up.
Let’s get back and make her more secure.”</p>

<p>They hurried to such good advantage that they
were almost at the place where they had left
the <i>Comet</i> when the rain came down. Professor
Snodgrass had already returned, without his toad.</p>

<p>“Boys!” he cried, “it’s going to be a deluge!
There will be a lot of water, and the river is
sure to rise very high. I think we had better
get in the airship, and go up until it’s over.
There may be air currents down here so powerful
that we can’t make headway against them.
My advice is to go up.”</p>

<p>The others thought this good, and so, in the
midst of the pelting rain, and against a current
of air that every moment grew stronger, the
<i>Comet</i> arose out of the canyon. Of course they
did not escape the rain by going up, but they were
in less danger. All night the storm continued,
but the adventurers were in comfortable circumstances,
for they had anchored in a little shelter
of rocks, securely tying down their craft.</p>

<p>“Well, now to see if there is any of Snake
Island left,” remarked Jerry next morning, when
the sun came out to dry up the dampness. “We’ll
have another try for the radium.”</p>

<p>Instead of stopping at the same place where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
they had made the first landing, Jerry sent the
airship toward the lower part of the island.</p>

<p>“We’ll begin there for a change,” he remarked.</p>

<p>It could easily be seen that the river had risen
considerably, and, had they remained anchored at
the spot where they had seen the “ghosts,” they
would have been in grave danger. Though the
water was now going down, it had lodged on the
upper part of the island many big trees and piles
of driftwood.</p>

<p>“Look at that!” suddenly cried Bob, as they
were hovering over the lower end of the island,
looking for a suitable landing place. “There’s
a hut on the side of the hill that I didn’t notice
before.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Jerry, gazing at a rude
structure of logs built under a sheltering bluff,
about a quarter of a mile from the shore. “We
passed over this place in the airship, too, but I
didn’t see that. We must see what it means.
Maybe there is some one living on this island.
Perhaps——”</p>

<p>He did not finish, but they all knew whom
he meant—Mr. Bentwell, the missing scientist,
might be there.</p>

<p>Ned took the binoculars, and directed them toward
the hut.</p>

<p>“I can’t see anyone there!” he cried. “But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
say—Oh, look! look!” and he almost screamed.
“The snakes! The snakes! There’s a regular
den of them, right in front of the hut! A nest
of serpents! Look!”</p>

<p>With trembling hands he passed the glass to
Jerry. As the tall lad looked through the binoculars
his face paled.</p>

<p>“No wonder they call this Snake Island!” he
murmured. “There must be thousands of them!
I’m glad we didn’t stay on the island last night.
Oh, look at those big snakes!”</p>

<small>LIVE WIRES</small></h2>


<p>“Where do you think they came from?”
asked Ned, when all, including the professor, had
viewed the snakes through the glass. Literally
there were hundreds, if not thousands, of reptiles.</p>

<p>They were wiggling and squirming, in and out
among the rocks and brushwood, just above the
mass of drift débris brought down by the flood.
All about, in front of the hut the snakes writhed,
seeming to be out of their usual haunts.</p>

<p>“The water must have brought them out from
their nests, or dens, or whatever it is that snakes
live in,” decided Bob.</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” asked Jerry, of Professor
Snodgrass. “Why would water bring out
snakes. I thought they liked heat.”</p>

<p>“They do,” answered the scientist, who was
eagerly looking at the snakes through the glass.
“But in this case I think the water brought them
<em>down</em>, instead of bringing them <em>out</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“How do you mean?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Why, I think the rising river inundated some
place along the canyon walls, where these snakes
lived. They were washed out, carried down
stream by the flood, and deposited here—stranded,
so to speak. I think it has been done
often before, in years past, and that is why they
call this Snake Island.”</p>

<p>“I believe you’re right,” agreed Jerry. “And
I don’t think the big stone pile in the middle had
anything to do with the name, though it may look
like a snake at times. Probably the Indians, in
years past, saw snakes brought down in the flood,
and they named the island after the serpents.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad they’re not at the other end
of the island,” spoke Ned, who disliked snakes.
“We’d better go back there and start over again
on our search for the radium. The river is going
down fast.”</p>

<p>“There may be snakes where we were before,”
suggested Jerry. “We didn’t look very closely.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it!” cried Ned with a shudder.
“Let’s get away from here, anyhow. I
can’t bear to look at ’em.”</p>

<p>“Um,” spoke the professor musingly. “I
think I should like to go down there.”</p>

<p>“What! Among those snakes?” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, as far as I can make out they don’t seem
to be poisonous, and, though there are some good-sized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
ones there, I don’t see any of the constrictor
variety. I think it would be perfectly safe to
go down.”</p>

<p>“But what do you want of snakes?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“I don’t want any snakes, but, where there are
serpents, there may be toads, and I might find my
two-tailed specimen. Of course if you boys don’t
want to go down you can let me off at some spot
where there are no snakes, and I can walk to this
place. I’m not afraid.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go down with you!” exclaimed Jerry
stoutly. “I think——”</p>

<p>But he never finished the sentence. At that
moment the door of the hut, in front of which
the serpents were writhing, was swung open, and
three figures, each armed with a club, stood in
the portal, waving their hands to our friends in
the airship.</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Quick! The glasses!” demanded Jerry, and
when he had them he focused the binoculars on
the trio in the hut on Snake Island. Then the tall
lad uttered a cry of wonder.</p>

<p>“It’s Noddy Nixon!” gasped Jerry. “Noddy
Nixon, and Bill Berry! And the other man is
that dishonest professor! How in the world did
they get there?”</p>

<p>“Are you sure it’s them?” asked Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure!” answered Jerry, and, a moment later,
the airship having approached closer, it could be
seen, without the glasses, that those in the hut
were indeed the bully and his cronies.</p>

<p>“Help! Help!” cried Noddy, waving his
hands in appeal to the boys whom he had treated
so meanly. “Help, or the snakes will kill us.”</p>

<p>“They’re not poisonous,” shouted the professor.
“Go at them with your clubs.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are poisonous!” answered Noddy.
“There were some jack rabbits washed down
with the snakes, and some of the serpents bit ’em.
The rabbits died right away. They’re poisonous
snakes, all right! Help us!”</p>

<p>“That makes it different,” said the professor
seriously. “I didn’t think they were poisonous,
but they may be. I wonder what we had better
do?”</p>

<p>“Help! Help!” cried Noddy again. A mass
of the serpents seemed to be advancing toward
the hut. Bill Berry threw a stick at them, and
the reptiles wiggled off in another direction.</p>

<p>“How did you get in the hut?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“We came down the river in a boat. We
were wrecked, and cast on this island. Oh, we’re
nearly starved, and if you save us we’ll never
bother you again!” promised Noddy. “Save us
from the snakes!”</p>

<p>“Shall we do it?” asked Ned of his chums.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“For the sake of humanity we can’t leave ’em
there,” said Jerry. “We’ve got to save ’em;
but how? We can’t go down there among all
those snakes.”</p>

<p>There was a pause, while the airship hovered
over the hut on the island, in the midst of the
snakes. The three conspirators eagerly watched
the motor boys.</p>

<p>“Those were the three persons we saw in the
boat in the rapids,” said Bob in a low voice, and
his chums nodded.</p>

<p>“Can we save them?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes!” cried the professor. “There is only
one way.”</p>

<p>“How?” demanded the tall lad.</p>

<p>“By live wires! Take some uninsulated electrical
wires, Jerry. Attach them to the dynamo,
let them dangle down from the airship, and then
sail over the mass of serpents. The wires will
hit the snakes and electrocute them. It’s the only
way!”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll do it!” cried Jerry. “Come on,
boys, and we’ll drop the live wires, and save
Noddy Nixon!” A moment later several coils
of copper conductors, each one carrying a deadly
current, were being dropped toward the surface

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br />
<small>THE TRANSPORTING OF NODDY</small></h2>


<p>“Just a little lower down, Ned. That’s it.
Now to the left, there’s a big bunch of ’em there.
No, that’s too much! Back up a little. Whoa!
Hold me there!”</p>

<p>Jerry was in the motor room, working the connections
to the dangling wires by means of which
it was hoped to electrocute the serpents that had
made prisoners of Noddy and his cronies in the
hut on Snake Island. Ned was in the pilot house,
directing the course of the <i>Comet</i>. The professor
and Bob stood by, ready to lend whatever assistance
was needed, while the prisoners in the
hut, standing in the door, ready for an instant
retreat, watched with anxious eyes the preparations
for their rescue.</p>

<p>“Are you going to try and electrocute every
snake?” asked Bob of his tall chum.</p>

<p>“As many as we can, Chunky.”</p>

<p>“But that will take quite a while, to drag the
wires across every one.”</p>

<p>“We won’t have to do that,” replied Jerry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
as he looked through the plate glass window in
the floor of the motor room, one hand on the
switch that controlled the electrical current, while
in the other he grasped a speaking tube, by which
he gave orders to Ned in the pilot house. “You
see, Bob, the snakes’ bodies are moist, and moisture
is a good conductor of electricity. So if I
can drag a live wire over a bunch of snakes, and
only touch one, the current will go through all
of ’em, and kill the whole lot. They’ll help to
kill themselves.”</p>

<p>“I see!” exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“Watch now, we’re going to begin!” cried
Jerry, and his chum, looking down, saw the wires
carrying the powerful current writhe and twist
about, almost like snakes themselves. From the
exposed ends there shot out a shower of blue
sparks.</p>

<p><a href="#image04">Suddenly one of the conductors touched a mass
of snakes</a>, that seemed tied in knots. A moment
before the snakes had been twining in and
out, hissing stridently. The next instant they
were as if turned to stone, for they had been
killed at once.</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_218">SUDDENLY ONE OF THE CONDUCTORS TOUCHED A
MASS OF SNAKES.</a></div>
</div>

<p>“That’s the way to do it!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>Again a wire, twisting and turning, was
dragged over a mass of serpents, and the life
went out of them. Time after time this happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
until the writhing snakes were more than
half destroyed.</p>

<p>“That’s a new and wonderful way to kill
snakes,” said the professor, as he looked on. “I
hope you aren’t killing any two-tailed toads.”</p>

<p>“They’ll be just as good for specimens,” remarked
Jerry as he turned on more power, sending
the wires that dangled from the airship, swirling
about, carrying death and destruction.</p>

<p>At length, so great was the slaughter, that the
snakes became terrified at the unknown power,
and with angry hisses, they began crawling away
in the crevices of the rocks, and under the bushes.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s enough,” announced Jerry,
when he could see none but dead serpents. “You
can come out now, Noddy!” he shouted to the
bully, for the airship was close to the hut. Jerry
began pulling up the wires, the current having
been shut off.</p>

<p>“Oh, take us away! Take us away from this
awful island!” begged Noddy. “We won’t
bother you again. We’re sorry we ever followed
you; aren’t we, Bill?”</p>

<p>“I am,” replied Noddy’s crony, thoroughly
cowed.</p>

<p>“But we have as good a right to stay and
hunt for the radium as they have!” put in Dr.
Belgrade sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you stay!” cried Noddy. “I’ve had
enough! I’m going back home.”</p>

<p>“And desert me?” asked the renegade professor.</p>

<p>“I don’t care anything about you! I wish I’d
never come on this trip. Oh, Jerry, I’ll never
bother you again, as long as I live if you only set
me on the main land. We can’t get to shore unless
you help us, because the current is too swift.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” asked Jerry of his
chums.</p>

<p>“Transport him,” suggested Ned. “We
want the island to ourselves, if we hunt for the
radium treasure. This is an easy way to get rid
of Noddy.”</p>

<p>The others agreed to this, and accordingly the
airship was let down in front of the hut. The
professor began searching among the dead snakes
for a two-tailed toad, but did not find any.</p>

<p>Noddy lost no time in scrambling aboard the
<i>Comet</i>. Bill Berry followed, and Dr. Belgrade
much against his will, did likewise. He scowled
at the boys and the professor, but they took no
notice of him. As Jerry had said, the less they
had to do with the plotters the better it would be.</p>

<p>Noddy was hysterically thankful to the motor
boys, but they well knew he might, at the first
chance, play some mean trick on them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“How did you come to get to the hut?”
asked Jerry.</p>

<p>Noddy briefly told his story. He did not mention
taking the airship, nor the other unfair things
he had done. He said he and his cronies had
managed to reach the canyon, and, in spite of the
advice of guides, they decided to try to float down
the river in a boat. They took provisions with
them, but were wrecked in the rapids. They
managed to reach the island, and some of their
provisions floated ashore. They had landed near
the hut, which they found easily, and took shelter
in there, hoping against hope for a rescue. They
were at the opposite end of the island from where
our friends had first landed.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll give you some provisions, and
you’ll have to get to civilization the best way you
can,” said Jerry to the bully and his cronies, as
they were landed on top of the bluffs, and supplied
with food and water. “You’ve made trouble
enough for us.”</p>

<p>“We left some of our food and things in
the hut,” said Noddy, as Jerry and his chums
were about to sail away. “After the flood which
brought the snakes down, we didn’t dare go out.
There was some stuff in the hut when we reached
it. I think someone had been there just before
we were.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“What?” cried Jerry. “Someone had been
in the hut recently?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it,” spoke Noddy. “There
was food in some boxes when we took shelter
there. And some books, and papers with writing
on. But we didn’t see anyone while we were
there until you came, and we were never gladder
to see anybody than you. We couldn’t find any
radium. I’m sorry I treated you so mean,
and——”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind,” interrupted Jerry, in
whose brain many thoughts were whirling about.
“Are you sure someone had been in the hut
recently?”</p>

<p>“Positive. You can ask Bill Berry.”</p>

<p>But Jerry had no desire to do this. He preferred
to look for himself. Bill was sullen and
angry, and so was Dr. Belgrade. Both knew
that the game was up. But no attention was
paid to them.</p>

<p>With no very hearty good-byes, our friends
watched the trio of unpleasant ones depart.
They could reach civilization in a day or so, and
they had enough to eat and drink for that time.</p>

<p>“Now come on!” cried Jerry to his chums.
“Come on, Professor,” for the scientist was chasing
after a new kind of bug.</p>

<p>“Where to now, Jerry?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Back to the hut on Snake Island. I’m going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
to see who has been living there, and what has
become of him.”</p>

<p>“Then you think it might be——”</p>

<p>“I’m going to make sure before I say anything,”
interrupted the tall lad, as he sent the airship
aloft.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<small>THE RISING FLOOD</small></h2>


<p>“Well, I don’t see much here to help us,”
remarked Bob.</p>

<p>“No, not much that tells anything definite,”
agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Except parts of what seem to be a journal,
or diary,” added Ned.</p>

<p>“But those same leaves from the journal tell
a sad story,” spoke Professor Snodgrass.</p>

<p>The three boys and the scientist were in the
hut on Snake Island. It was the day after they
had taken Noddy and his cronies off, and they
were seeking for traces of the person who, according
to the bully, had been in the hut before
they arrived. They found some preserved food,
older than any Noddy could have brought, and
scattered pages of a diary.</p>

<p>“It is evident that someone—most likely a
man—lived here for a time,” went on the professor,
“and that up to recently, he kept an account
of his day’s doings, for here is the last entry
we can find, dated about a month ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“What does it say?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“The same thing as for many days before.
‘Searched for it, but could not find it.’”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose ‘it’ can be?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>The professor was silent a moment, and then
he said quietly:</p>

<p>“Radium.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Jerry. “Do you think someone
has been here ahead of us, looking for the
radium treasure?”</p>

<p>“I am sure of it,” said Uriah Snodgrass, “and
what is more, I believe it was Mr. Bentwell.”</p>

<p>“Then where is he now?” demanded Bob.</p>

<p>“That I don’t know,” and the professor’s
voice was solemn. “Probably he is dead. He
must have been here on this lonely island nearly
a year. How he lived in that time no one can
tell. When he and his companions were wrecked
there must have been some food saved. Or, he
may have been able to trap, or kill, small animals
that are on the island, or that were brought
down by the floods. He may have caught fish.
At any rate, we know that someone was alive
here up to a month ago, for the date in the book
tells us that. Where he went to, we can only
guess.”</p>

<p>“The snakes,” suggested Ned in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, the snakes may have killed him,” agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the professor. “It is a sad ending to the life
of a noted scholar, alone on this terrible island.
I shall preserve this record he has left, for his
family.”</p>

<p>“But where is the rest of it?” asked Jerry.
“There are only a few pages here.”</p>

<p>“The others were destroyed, somehow,” replied
Professor Snodgrass. “The same agency
that made away with Mr. Bentwell may have destroyed
the record of his uneventful search, or
Noddy and his cronies, not understanding the
value of the book, may have used pages of it to
light a fire with, for on the hearth you can see
where a fire has recently been kindled. It is too
bad, for a scientific person, like Mr. Bentwell,
probably made valuable observations of what took
place in this wonderful canyon of the Colorado.”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t doing us any good to stay here,”
spoke Jerry. “It’s only making us more gloomy.
I vote that we get out, and make a careful search
for the radium. We won’t be bothered by
Noddy and his crowd now, and there isn’t likely
to be another flood, right away.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you,” said the professor. “We
will be better off by doing some active work.
I’ll take charge of what is left of the journal, and
we’ll begin our search. What food is left we’ll
pack away in the hut. Who knows but what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
some other daring adventurer, who seeks to navigate
the river, may be wrecked here? It may
save his life.”</p>

<p>The food was carefully put away, and it was
likely to keep for some time, since there were no
evidences that the waters had ever risen quite as
high as the hut. Then our friends began their
search.</p>

<p>It was kept up for several days, and, as thoroughly
as they could, they covered every part of
the island, beginning at the shore and working
back toward the big mound in the center, with its
tall pillar of sandstone rock.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have to make a record in our
notebooks, the same as poor Mr. Bentwell did,
‘nothing doing,’” remarked Bob one day, after
nearly a week of searching.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got all that hill to explore yet,”
replied Ned. “And that’s the most likely place
for the radium; isn’t it, Professor?”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t say that it is,” was the reply of
the scientist. “I think, if we find it at all, that
it will be on comparatively low ground. But it
begins to look as if our hunt for the treasure was
likely to result in failure.”</p>

<p>“And you haven’t got your two-tailed toad
yet,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“No, but I have hopes, boys,” and with that
the professor, leaving the three chums to search<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
for traces of radium, went off by himself to look
for the specimen he so much wanted.</p>

<p>All that day the two searches were kept up,
but without result. At night they assembled in
the airship, which had been anchored on a level
piece of high ground, near the upper end of the
island, above the hut.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll put in a few more days,” suggested
Ned, as they arose from the supper table,
“and then I think we’d better get back home, and
admit that we’re beaten.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to give up,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” came from the professor.
“And yet I think we had better get ready to
leave. I don’t like the looks of the weather,
and the barometer is falling more rapidly than
I care to see it.”</p>

<p>“Do you think a storm is brewing?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“I do, and a bad one, too. I think we had
better stay here one more day, and then move.
I’ll have to look in some other place for the rare
toad.”</p>

<p>When they went to bed that night there was a
low muttering of thunder, and fitful lightning,
and Jerry insisted on his chums helping him make
the airship more secure by ropes attached to trees.</p>

<p>“We don’t want to be blown away in the
night,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>They all slept so soundly that they did not
notice the increasing roar of the river, as it rose
in flood, due to heavy rains above Snake Island.
The river was always roaring, as it tore past the
black cliffs, and split in twain at the island, and,
though the rain added to this noise, it did not
awaken the adventurers.</p>

<p>It was not until early morning that Ned, sitting
up in his berth, was conscious of an uneasy,
bobbing motion.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he cried, hopping out. “What’s
the matter? Why did you start, Jerry? I
thought you were going to stay another day.”</p>

<p>“Start! I haven’t started!” cried Jerry.
“What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>Then, as he leaped out on the floor, he nearly
lost his balance, as the <i>Comet</i> pitched and tossed.
Jerry gave a hasty glance out of the window.</p>

<p>“Boys,” he cried, “we’re afloat on the biggest
flood the Colorado ever had, I guess! We’re
still anchored, but the trees are under water!
The ropes are holding us!”</p>

<p>“But how can we float?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“On the hydroplanes, of course,” said Jerry.
“You know we’ve been resting on them, instead
of the bicycle wheels, for I wanted to take the
weight off the tires. Lucky for us that I did,
or we wouldn’t float. And now we’re on the surface
of the river, and it’s still rising!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a><br />
<small>IN THE CAVE</small></h2>


<p>Steadying themselves against the swaying motion
of the anchored airship, our friends crowded
to the windows to look out. They beheld a terrifying
and wonderful scene.</p>

<p>Almost the whole of the island was under
water. Only the high middle part, with its tower
of rock, was out of the flood. Securely held by
the anchor ropes, the <i>Comet</i>, as light as a chip on
the surface of the waves, floated on the bosom of
the flood. Her very lightness, due to the fact
that the gas bag was partly filled, and the strength
of the anchor ropes, had saved her. Then, too,
the fact that she rested on hydroplanes, or pontoons,
was in her favor. These were a new feature
of the airship, which had only recently been
added.</p>

<p>“Say, it’s lucky you thought to let the hydroplanes
down,” spoke Bob, as he looked out at
the flood sweeping past them.</p>

<p>“If he hadn’t, we’d probably be wrecked by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
this time,” was Ned’s opinion. The hydroplanes,
I might explain, were light hollow boxes, made
water tight, and attached to the <i>Comet</i> by long
toggle-jointed arms. They could be raised or
lowered at will, and allowed the <i>Comet</i> to float
on the surface of water. If you boys have
ever seen a water-spider, or bug, skimming along
on the brook or lake, as you doubtless have, you
will get a good idea of how the hydroplanes
worked by recalling to mind the insect.</p>

<p>“Well, what are we going to do?” asked Ned,
as he looked at the flood sweeping past. On the
surface of the water floated all manner of débris,
including much driftwood, and even whole trees.
“We can’t stay here,” went on the lad, “for we
may have a hole punched in us any minute.”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke there was a grinding sound,
and a log scraped along the side of the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’d better get out,” agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’ll get breakfast right away,” said Bob
briskly, “and then——”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t!” cried Ned. “No breakfast
until we’re out of danger. Why, we might
be wrecked, and then I’d like to know how we
could ever get out of this canyon,” and he looked
up at the towering cliffs on either hand—cliffs
that no mortal could scale. On each side—all
around them—was the raging flood, in which no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
craft, save one as light as an airship, could have
lived for a moment.</p>

<p>“It all depends on the airship,” agreed Jerry.
“We must get away while we can.”</p>

<p>The words were hardly out of his mouth before
there came a crash, and the craft trembled
from end to end. There was a splintering noise,
and Jerry sprang toward the stern.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“We’ve been hit! One of the hydroplanes is
smashed and a bicycle wheel crushed! We’ve
got to go up right away! Start the gas machine,
Ned. Bob, you come in the pilot house with me,
and help. Professor, you see that the motors get
plenty of oil; will you? We’ll need all the power
we’ve got.”</p>

<p>Instantly the interior of the <i>Comet</i> was a scene
of activity. The effect of the damage was at
once apparent, for the craft had settled on one
side. But as soon as the gas began flowing into
the bag she began to lift, until she was once more
on a level keel.</p>

<p>“All ready now?” called Jerry to Ned, in the
motor room.</p>

<p>“All ready—let her go! But what are you
going to do?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to land on the high ground near
the tower of sandstone. I can see a good level<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
place there, and the water can never get as high
as that. Besides, I want to make some repairs
before we try to make the mainland, and we can
make ’em there. We’ll stay on top of the hill
until the flood goes down. Give me full speed,
Ned. Tell the Professor to use lots of oil.”</p>

<p>As Ned turned to convey the request to the
scientist, Uriah Snodgrass, who had been looking
from a side window out on the flood, uttered a
cry of delight. The next instant he caught up a
small fish net, attached to a long handle, and
thrust it out of the window, into the swirling
water. Then he cried:</p>

<p>“I’ve got it! I’ve got it! Oh, you little
beauty! I’ve got you almost at the last minute,
when I least expected you. Oh, what a rare
find!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“The two-tailed toad! I saw it floating down
on a log, and I made a grab for it. I have it!”
and holding out the net he displayed a queer-looking
object—a hideous toad, covered with
“warts,” but having two unmistakable tails.</p>

<p>“Ugh! What a creature!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“A most valuable acquisition to science,” declared
the professor proudly.</p>

<p>There came a shrill whistle through the tube
leading to the pilot house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to start?” Jerry wanted to
know. “The river is still rising, and more logs
are coming down! Get a move on!”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye!” answered Ned, and he yanked
over the electrical switch. Instantly the propellers
whizzed around, and the <i>Comet</i> strained
at the mooring ropes.</p>

<p>“Now’s the time!” cried Jerry to Bob, who
had been provided with a light, keen hatchet, for
the purpose of severing the lines. “Cut!”</p>

<p>The little axe came down as the <i>Comet</i> lifted
her dripping hydroplanes out of the water, and,
freed from the holding cables, she soared aloft.
Jerry directed her toward the big hill in the middle
of the island, where there was room to land.
Fortunately there was scarcely any wind to sway
the craft, though the rain came down in torrents.</p>

<p>Well aloft now, over the raging flood of the
Colorado, the <i>Comet</i> was more like herself, and,
with Jerry to guide her, there was comparatively
little danger.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to be careful how you let her
down,” suggested Ned, when, having set the machinery
to working automatically, he joined his
tall chum in the pilot house. “You don’t want
to smash that hydroplane and wheel any more
than they are.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure not. We’ll be down in a few minutes,
and then we can get right to work.”</p>

<p>“What about the radium?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll look for that, too, as long as we’re
in no immediate danger. I hope we find it. The
Professor got what he wanted, and it’s up to us
to make good, too.”</p>

<p>It was but a short distance from where the
flood had floated the <i>Comet</i> to the place where
Jerry proposed to anchor, and, a little while after
arising, the airship came gently down. It required
no small skill to make a landing without
further damaging the broken parts, but Jerry
managed it.</p>

<p>“Make fast the ship! All hands out at anchor
work!”</p>

<p>The professor rather disliked to leave off making
notes about the two-tailed toad that the flood
had brought him, but he finally put the specimen
away, and joined the boys in the work of making
their craft secure.</p>

<p>They had landed on a small plateau, which
was, in a manner, cut in the side of the hill. Back
of it arose a steep cliff of sandstone, while the
surface of the shelf was covered with trees, grass
and bushes.</p>

<p>Ned, taking one rope, walked off to the left
to fasten it to a big stump that he thought would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
hold. As he came near it he glanced behind a
bush, and, as he did so he uttered a cry:</p>

<p>“Fellows, look here!” he shouted. “Here’s
a big cave leading right into the hill!”</p>

<p>Through the rain, splashing over the soaked
ground, came Bob and Jerry, the professor following.
They stood grouped about a hole in the
slope—a hole large enough to permit a man to
enter upright.</p>

<p>“Let’s go in and see what’s there,” proposed
Bob.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s safe,” came from Jerry.
“There are hardly likely to be any bears on this
island.”</p>

<p>Together they advanced into the cavern. It
was dark, but their eyes soon became somewhat
accustomed to the gloom.</p>

<p>“It’s too big to explore without a light,” remarked
the professor. “This may be a place
for valuable relics. Let’s fasten the airship, and
then come back with electrical torches.”</p>

<p>They turned to go, but, as they did so there
came a sound which startled all of them. It was
the sound of a human voice and, in cracked tones,
as if the speaker had not used his vocal cords
for some time.</p>

<p>“Who are you? What do you want?” was
demanded in hollow accents. And then there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
came a faint glimmer of light, and in the rays of
it they beheld a man—apparently a very old man—with
matted beard, tangled hair and hollow,
sunken eyes, who stood staring at them from the
depths of the cave.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a><br />
<small>THE RADIUM TREASURE—CONCLUSION</small></h2>


<p>“Bless my soul!” exclaimed Professor Snodgrass.</p>

<p>Bob, with a catching of his breath, and a nervous
tremor, started to run in a panic. But Jerry
caught him by the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” the tall lad cried. “It’s only a
man.”</p>

<p>“A—a man!” gasped the fat lad. “I
thought——”</p>

<p>“Stop thinking!” commanded Jerry.</p>

<p>The man in the cave advanced, and the boys
and the professor saw that he carried a torch
made from some resinous wood that burned with
much smoke.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” again demanded the man,
holding his torch on high. “Who comes here
to disturb me? Why can’t you let me die in
peace?”</p>

<p>The professor took a sudden resolve. Afterward
he said he did not know why he did it.</p>

<p>“Hartley Bentwell!” cried the scientist, “we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
have come to save you. You are not going to
die. We have come to take you away from Snake
Island!”</p>

<p>The effect of these words on the unfortunate
man was indescribable. He fairly leaped forward,
and a cry came from his lips.</p>

<p>“You know me!” he exclaimed. “You have
come to save me? Oh, the dear Lord be thanked!
Yes, I am Hartley Bentwell, but in a few days
more I would not have known myself. I—I fear
I was going mad. It was almost the end. Oh,
what a life I have lived on this island! Unable
to escape! Menaced by the snakes! Not a soul
to speak to! In fear of the floods! Oh, even
now, my mind is not right!”</p>

<p>“There, there!” exclaimed the professor
soothingly, as he would have talked to a child.
“You are with friends. You will soon be away
from here, and in your own home. We are going
to restore you to the world again. You have
seen the last of Snake Island.”</p>

<p>“The last of Snake Island! Oh——” but the
unfortunate castaway could say no more, for he
had fainted, and would have fallen, had not Jerry
and Ned caught him.</p>

<p>“Quick! Carry him to the <i>Comet</i>,” directed
the professor. “When he comes to, he must
find himself in brighter surroundings.”</p>

<p>This was quickly done, and, as the rain soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
stopped, and the sun came out, when Mr. Bentwell
became conscious, he found himself in a
pleasant cabin, surrounded by his new friends.
A look of wonder came over his face, and the
wild, half-insane stare faded from his eyes.</p>

<p>“Here, drink this,” commanded Uriah Snodgrass,
and he held out a bowl of nourishing soup.</p>

<p>And, following a refreshing sleep, that afternoon,
while seated in the airship cabin, Mr. Bentwell
told his story. He had been with the scientists
who, about a year before, had come to search
for the radium on Snake Island. There had been
an accident, one boat was wrecked, and the unfortunate
man was cast alone on the island. His
companions escaped, and got back to civilization,
believing him drowned.</p>

<p>The cargo of the boat, consisting of a considerable
quantity of provisions, stores and tools, was
washed up on the island.</p>

<p>He built the hut, and rudely furnished it.
Then, having nothing else to do, being unable to
escape from the island, he began a search for the
radium, as told in his torn notebook. But he
could not find it.</p>

<p>Then floods came, there were several visitations
of snakes, and, in terror, he fled to the hill,
where he found the cave that he made his home,
only going occasionally to the hut. He had been
away from it for several days when Noddy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
his companions took up their abode there. So
despondent and gloomy was Mr. Bentwell over
his plight that he withdrew to the cave altogether,
and stayed there, living on scanty food. He did
not come out, and so did not see the airship making
trips over the island.</p>

<p>“But now I am saved!” he cried. “Let us
get away from this awful place!”</p>

<p>“I am willing,” agreed the professor. “I
have my valuable toad.”</p>

<p>“But we haven’t the radium,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“I do not believe it is here,” said Mr. Bentwell.
“I searched all over for it, and found not
a trace.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we saw your notes,” spoke the professor.
“I saved what were left of them for
you.”</p>

<p>The weather soon became pleasant again, and
the river went down. But the boys in their airship
remained on the hill, as they liked it better
there. Jerry asked for three days more in which
to search for the radium treasure, and the others
agreed to this.</p>

<p>“Well, I give up,” admitted Jerry, on the
afternoon of the third day, when, after a wearying
search, he and his two chums were returning
to the <i>Comet</i>. “We’ll start for home to-morrow
morning. Mr. Bentwell is well enough to
travel now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>“I sort of hate to go back empty handed,”
spoke Ned regretfully. “It’s the first time we
ever had a real failure.”</p>

<p>“We can’t always be successful,” commented
Bob. “Whew! I’m tired. I’m going to have
a rest.”</p>

<p>He sat down on a grassy spot. Just below
them was the <i>Comet</i>, which had been fully repaired,
and was all ready for the homeward trip.
Ned and Jerry walked on a little way, and then
took a seat on a log, for they, too, were weary.
They talked over their adventures, agreeing that,
even though they had not found the radium treasure,
they had had a good vacation.</p>

<p>Bob suddenly jumped up, and rubbed his thigh.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter; sit on a thorn?” asked
Ned with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Something like that,” answered the stout lad.
“Or else a bee stung me. Well, come on. It’s
all over.”</p>

<p>They were packing up that night, ready for
the trip home in the morning, when Bob complained
of a burning sensation in his leg.</p>

<p>“Better let me look at it,” suggested the professor,
who knew something of medicine. “You
may have been poisoned by some insect.” But,
when he had looked at a peculiar red spot on
Bob’s leg he cried out:</p>

<p>“Boys, that’s the most wonderful thing I ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
heard of! Bob has solved the riddle for us!”</p>

<p>“What riddle?” demanded Jerry eagerly.</p>

<p>“The radium riddle! That’s a blister caused
by emanations from radium!” went on the professor.
“Look at it, Mr. Bentwell, and see if
you don’t think so!”</p>

<p>The castaway, who had had his hair cut, and
who had shaved himself, being attired in a spare
suit of the professor’s, looked at the red spot.</p>

<p>“That is undoubtedly a radium burn,” he said
quickly. “How did it happen?”</p>

<p>“It must have been when I sat down to rest,”
explained Bob. “On the hill out there. I felt
something sting me, and——”</p>

<p>“It was the radium!” cried Mr. Bentwell.
“Where is the place? Let us go to it at once!”</p>

<p>“We can’t find it in the dark,” objected Jerry,
but the professor and the castaway hurried out
on the deck of the airship leading Bob with them.</p>

<p>“Point out, as nearly as you can, where it was,”
begged Uriah Snodgrass.</p>

<p>Bob raised his hand, and, as he did so, he uttered
a cry.</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” he gasped. “The ghosts!
The ghosts again!”</p>

<p>There, floating down toward the airship, were
tall whitish objects, wrapped in a bluish haze,
like the tall forms of willowy beings shrouded in
mist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“The ghosts!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, radium ghosts!” fairly shouted Professor
Snodgrass. “I understand it now. I wonder
I didn’t guess it the first time. The ghosts
we saw before were vapors, caused by radium.
It is the same now. Boys, we have at last found
the radium treasure! We will get it in the morning!”</p>

<p>They were up at dawn, after an almost sleepless
night. Bob pointed out the spot where he
had rested, and digging there, under a thin layer
of sod, was found the peculiar hornblende rock
mixed with pitchblende, which contained the radium.
It needed but a simple test to demonstrate
this.</p>

<p>“And the peculiar thing about it is this,” said
Professor Snodgrass. “Usually it takes tons of
rock to produce even a grain of radium, but in
this case there is almost pure radium in this sample.
We must be careful of it, for, not only is
it very valuable, but it may seriously harm us if
left exposed.”</p>

<p>Accordingly the first sample was put in the
lead receptacle prepared for it, and the work of
digging the rock for more was begun.</p>

<p>But if our friends hoped to find an enormous
fortune of radium on Snake Island they were disappointed.
For, after they had dug a little distance
down, the rock disappeared, and there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
no more of it. Search as they did, there was
only a comparatively small quantity. But that
was of great value, sufficient to more than compensate
them for the trip, for the radium, being
almost pure, commanded an exceptionally high
price.</p>

<p>“But there must be some where we first saw
the strange ghosts,” suggested Bob. They went
to the place, but found nothing. As there was a
deep hollow, where before there had been none,
they concluded that the flood had washed the
precious radium away.</p>

<p>“But we have enough to satisfy almost anyone,”
said Jerry, one evening a few nights later.</p>

<p>In the days following Bob’s unexpected discovery
of the precious stuff they had searched
diligently, but no more was located.</p>

<p>“I think we have all there is here,” was the
professor’s opinion, and Mr. Bentwell agreed
with him. There was no longer any use in remaining
in that desolate place, and so they arose,
and left behind Snake Island, and the rushing
river cutting its way through the mighty chasm,
a mile below the surface of the earth.</p>

<p>Then, with her nose pointed toward Denver,
the return trip began. Little worth mentioning
occurred on it. Mr. Bentwell continued to improve
and after a short stay in Denver, at the
Montrose home, nearly all traces of his terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
year on the lonely island disappeared. Of course
the story of the boys caused much comment, and
they were regarded as heroes.</p>

<p>They received many offers for their radium,
but they refused nearly all of them, giving a share
of the stuff to Mr. Bentwell, some to Professor
Snodgrass, and a portion to Mr. Montrose. The
latter was interested in a Denver hospital that
very much wanted some of the precious metal for
medical purposes.</p>

<p>As for their portions the boys kept some for
themselves for future use, and some they gave to
the academy they attended. The rest they sold
for a large sum.</p>

<p>Nothing more was heard from Noddy Nixon,
save that he and Bill got safely home, after much
hardship. As for the renegade professor he
and Noddy quarreled, and separated.</p>

<p>“Let’s go all the way home by airship,” proposed
Bob as they were about to leave Denver.
“We can have the auto shipped to Cresville, and
it’s much easier to get meals in the <i>Comet</i> than
at hotels.”</p>

<p>“Bob, if you mention eating again, until we
get home, we’ll put you on a bread and water
diet,” threatened Ned, and Bob went off to the
galley in a huff. But he was soon heard whistling
as he made himself some sandwiches.</p>

<p>The airship trip was voted the best, and accordingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
it was undertaken. All went well,
and in due time they were near their home town.
At his request, Mr. Bentwell was allowed to leave
the ship at a place where he could get a train to
his home, for he did not want to take his new
friends out of their way. He had telegraphed,
at the first opportunity, to his relatives, telling
them of his rescue. To say that they, and the
world at large, were surprised by his wonderful
story, is putting it mildly.</p>

<p>“Well, we got the radium treasure, after all,”
remarked Jerry, one day a week or so later, when
they were all assembled at his house.</p>

<p>“And I caught the two-tailed toad,” added the
professor. “My college has conferred additional
honors upon me for that. I am indeed
a lucky individual.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what you’ll look for next?” spoke
Bob.</p>

<p>“And I wonder what we’ll do?” added
Ned.</p>

<p>Those of you who care to know, may learn by
reading the next volume of the series, which will
be called “The Motor Boys on the Border; Or,
Sixty Nuggets of Gold,” a strange tale of the Far
West and of Canada.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked the professor, “I think I
will——” He stopped suddenly, sprang to a
small table, and clapped his hand down on it so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
suddenly that he upset a pitcher of lemonade,
which spilled all over Bob.</p>

<p>“Ouch! Ugh!” gasped the fat lad. “What’s
the matter?”</p>

<p>“I just caught a most rare specimen of a red-winged
fly,” answered the professor, pulling out
a specimen box and imprisoning the luckless insect.</p>

<p>“But—l-l-look at me!” gasped Bob. “I’m
all wet!”</p>

<p>“Never mind, it’s a hot day, and you aren’t
the only lemon in the house,” laughed Jerry, as
he helped his chum dry himself.</p>

<p>Of course Professor Snodgrass apologized, and
made amends by helping squeeze more lemons.
And then, sitting about, he and the boys discussed
their adventures on the trip after the radium
treasure. And now, for a time, we will say good-bye
to them.</p>

<p class="noi adtitle">The Racer Boys Series</p>

<p class="noi adauthor">by CLARENCE YOUNG</p>

<p class="noic">Author of “The Motor Boys Series”, “Jack Ranger Series”, etc. etc.<br />
Fine cloth binding. Illustrated. Price per vol. 60 cts. postpaid.</p>

<p>The announcement of a new series of stories by Mr. Clarence Young is
always hailed with delight by boys and girls throughout the country,
and we predict an even greater success for these new books, than that
now enjoyed by the “Motor Boys”. The stories are in Mr. Young’s
best vein, full of vim and vigor from start to finish, and of a high
moral order. They are in the same style that has made “The Motor
Boys Series” the most popular young people’s line on the market.</p>


<p class="noi adauthor">The Racer Boys<br />
<small>or The Mystery of the Wreck</small></p>

<p>This, the first volume of the new series, tells who the Racer Boys were
and how they chanced to be out on the ocean in a great storm. They
rescue another boy in a wrecked motor-boat and take him to their
home only to discover later that the stranger has lost his mind and cannot
remember who he is or where he comes from. Adventures follow each
other in rapid succession, and the Racer Boys finally solve the mystery
in a manner that only our author, Mr. Young, can describe.</p>


<p class="noi adauthor">The Racer Boys At Boarding School<br />
<small>or Striving for the Championship</small></p>

<p>When the Racer Boys arrived at the school they found everything at a
stand-still. The school was going down rapidly and the students lacked
ambition and leadership. They lacked even the heart to take part in
any athletic contests. The Racers took hold with a will, and got their
father to aid the head of the school financially, and then reorganized
the football team. Much to the astonishment of everybody, the school
won the championship of the league.</p>


<p class="noi adauthor">The Racer Boys To The Rescue<br />
<small>or Stirring Days in a Winter Camp</small></p>

<p>Here is a story filled with the spirit of good times in winter—skating,
ice-boating and hunting. How the lads went out after big game, how
they stumbled upon a queer trail and made a great discovery, and how
they came to the rescue of a crippled boy who was virtually held a
prisoner in a wilderness cabin, are related in a manner to chain the attention
of the reader from beginning to end.</p>
